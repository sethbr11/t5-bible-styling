Genesis,1,1,"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."
Genesis,1,2,The earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep and God’s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.
Genesis,1,3,"God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light."
Genesis,1,4,"God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness."
Genesis,1,5,"God called the light “day”, and the darkness he called “night”. There was evening and there was morning, the first day."
Genesis,1,6,"God said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.”"
Genesis,1,7,"God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so."
Genesis,1,8,"God called the expanse “sky”. There was evening and there was morning, a second day."
Genesis,1,9,"God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so."
Genesis,1,10,"God called the dry land “earth”, and the gathering together of the waters he called “seas”. God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,11,"God said, “Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seeds, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with their seeds in it, on the earth”; and it was so."
Genesis,1,12,"The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with their seeds in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,13,"There was evening and there was morning, a third day."
Genesis,1,14,"God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs to mark seasons, days, and years;"
Genesis,1,15,and let them be for lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth”; and it was so.
Genesis,1,16,"God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also made the stars."
Genesis,1,17,"God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light to the earth,"
Genesis,1,18,"and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,19,"There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day."
Genesis,1,20,"God said, “Let the waters abound with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.”"
Genesis,1,21,"God created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,22,"God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”"
Genesis,1,23,"There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day."
Genesis,1,24,"God said, “Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind”; and it was so."
Genesis,1,25,"God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good."
Genesis,1,26,"God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”"
Genesis,1,27,God created man in his own image. In God’s image he created him; male and female he created them.
Genesis,1,28,"God blessed them. God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”"
Genesis,1,29,"God said, “Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food."
Genesis,1,30,"To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food;” and it was so."
Genesis,1,31,"God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day."
Genesis,2,1,"The heavens, the earth, and all their vast array were finished."
Genesis,2,2,On the seventh day God finished his work which he had done; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.
Genesis,2,3,"God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested in it from all his work of creation which he had done."
Genesis,2,4,"This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens."
Genesis,2,5,"No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a man to till the ground,"
Genesis,2,6,"but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground."
Genesis,2,7,"Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."
Genesis,2,8,"Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed."
Genesis,2,9,"Out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food, including the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil."
Genesis,2,10,"A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became the source of four rivers."
Genesis,2,11,"The name of the first is Pishon: it flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;"
Genesis,2,12,and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium and onyx stone are also there.
Genesis,2,13,The name of the second river is Gihon. It is the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush.
Genesis,2,14,The name of the third river is Hiddekel. This is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
Genesis,2,15,"Yahweh God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it."
Genesis,2,16,"Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, “You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;"
Genesis,2,17,"but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.”"
Genesis,2,18,"Yahweh God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make him a helper comparable to him.”"
Genesis,2,19,"Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called every living creature became its name."
Genesis,2,20,"The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not found a helper comparable to him."
Genesis,2,21,"Yahweh God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep. As the man slept, he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place."
Genesis,2,22,"Yahweh God made a woman from the rib which he had taken from the man, and brought her to the man."
Genesis,2,23,"The man said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called ‘woman,’ because she was taken out of Man.”"
Genesis,2,24,"Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh."
Genesis,2,25,"The man and his wife were both naked, and they were not ashamed."
Genesis,3,1,"Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh God had made. He said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?’”"
Genesis,3,2,"The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden,"
Genesis,3,3,"but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, ‘You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you die.’”"
Genesis,3,4,"The serpent said to the woman, “You won’t really die,"
Genesis,3,5,"for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”"
Genesis,3,6,"When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate; and she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate it, too."
Genesis,3,7,"Their eyes were opened, and they both knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made coverings for themselves."
Genesis,3,8,"They heard Yahweh God’s voice walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden."
Genesis,3,9,"Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?”"
Genesis,3,10,"The man said, “I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.”"
Genesis,3,11,"God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”"
Genesis,3,12,"The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”"
Genesis,3,13,"Yahweh God said to the woman, “What have you done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”"
Genesis,3,14,"Yahweh God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, you are cursed above all livestock, and above every animal of the field. You shall go on your belly and you shall eat dust all the days of your life."
Genesis,3,15,"I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel.”"
Genesis,3,16,"To the woman he said, “I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth. In pain you will bear children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.”"
Genesis,3,17,"To Adam he said, “Because you have listened to your wife’s voice, and ate from the tree, about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat of it,’ the ground is cursed for your sake. You will eat from it with much labor all the days of your life."
Genesis,3,18,It will yield thorns and thistles to you; and you will eat the herb of the field.
Genesis,3,19,"By the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For you are dust, and to dust you shall return.”"
Genesis,3,20,The man called his wife Eve because she would be the mother of all the living.
Genesis,3,21,"Yahweh God made coats of animal skins for Adam and for his wife, and clothed them."
Genesis,3,22,"Yahweh God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever—”"
Genesis,3,23,"Therefore Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken."
Genesis,3,24,"So he drove out the man; and he placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life."
Genesis,4,1,"The man knew Eve his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Cain, and said, “I have gotten a man with Yahweh’s help.”"
Genesis,4,2,"Again she gave birth, to Cain’s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground."
Genesis,4,3,"As time passed, Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground."
Genesis,4,4,"Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. Yahweh respected Abel and his offering,"
Genesis,4,5,"but he didn’t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell."
Genesis,4,6,"Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?"
Genesis,4,7,"If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.”"
Genesis,4,8,"Cain said to Abel, his brother, “Let’s go into the field.” While they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him."
Genesis,4,9,"Yahweh said to Cain, “Where is Abel, your brother?” He said, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”"
Genesis,4,10,"Yahweh said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries to me from the ground."
Genesis,4,11,"Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand."
Genesis,4,12,"From now on, when you till the ground, it won’t yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.”"
Genesis,4,13,"Cain said to Yahweh, “My punishment is greater than I can bear."
Genesis,4,14,"Behold, you have driven me out today from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. Whoever finds me will kill me.”"
Genesis,4,15,"Yahweh said to him, “Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.” Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, so that anyone finding him would not strike him."
Genesis,4,16,"Cain left Yahweh’s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden."
Genesis,4,17,"Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch."
Genesis,4,18,To Enoch was born Irad. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech.
Genesis,4,19,"Lamech took two wives: the name of the first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah."
Genesis,4,20,"Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock."
Genesis,4,21,"His brother’s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe."
Genesis,4,22,"Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. Tubal Cain’s sister was Naamah."
Genesis,4,23,"Lamech said to his wives, “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice. You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech, for I have slain a man for wounding me, a young man for bruising me."
Genesis,4,24,"If Cain will be avenged seven times, truly Lamech seventy-seven times.”"
Genesis,4,25,"Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, saying, “for God has given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.”"
Genesis,4,26,"A son was also born to Seth, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on Yahweh’s name."
Genesis,5,1,"This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him in God’s likeness."
Genesis,5,2,"He created them male and female, and blessed them. On the day they were created, he named them “Adam”."

Genesis,5,5,"All the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years, then he died."
Genesis,5,6,"Seth lived one hundred five years, then became the father of Enosh."

Genesis,6,3,"Yahweh said, “My Spirit will not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; so his days will be one hundred twenty years.”"
Genesis,6,4,"The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when God’s sons came in to men’s daughters and had children with them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown."

Genesis,6,9,"This is the history of the generations of Noah: Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time. Noah walked with God."

Genesis,6,14,"Make a ship of gopher wood. You shall make rooms in the ship, and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch."

Genesis,6,16,"You shall make a roof in the ship, and you shall finish it to a cubit upward. You shall set the door of the ship in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels."
Genesis,6,17,"I, even I, do bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky. Everything that is in the earth will die."
Genesis,6,18,"But I will establish my covenant with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you."

Genesis,6,21,"Take with you some of all food that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it will be for food for you, and for them.”"
Genesis,6,22,Thus Noah did. He did all that God commanded him.
Genesis,7,1,"Yahweh said to Noah, “Come with all of your household into the ship, for I have seen your righteousness before me in this generation."
Genesis,7,2,"You shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you, the male and his female. Of the animals that are not clean, take two, the male and his female."
Genesis,7,3,"Also of the birds of the sky, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth."
Genesis,7,4,"In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights. I will destroy every living thing that I have made from the surface of the ground.”"
Genesis,7,5,Noah did everything that Yahweh commanded him.
Genesis,7,6,Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth.
Genesis,7,7,"Noah went into the ship with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, because of the floodwaters."
Genesis,7,8,"Clean animals, unclean animals, birds, and everything that creeps on the ground"
Genesis,7,9,"went by pairs to Noah into the ship, male and female, as God commanded Noah."
Genesis,7,10,"After the seven days, the floodwaters came on the earth."
Genesis,7,11,"In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the sky’s windows opened."
Genesis,7,12,It rained on the earth forty days and forty nights.
Genesis,7,13,"In the same day Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth—the sons of Noah—and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ship—"
Genesis,7,14,"they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort."
Genesis,7,15,Pairs from all flesh with the breath of life in them went into the ship to Noah.
Genesis,7,16,"Those who went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him; then Yahweh shut him in."
Genesis,7,17,"The flood was forty days on the earth. The waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth."
Genesis,7,18,"The waters rose, and increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters."
Genesis,7,19,The waters rose very high on the earth. All the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered.
Genesis,7,20,"The waters rose fifteen cubits higher, and the mountains were covered."
Genesis,7,21,"All flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man."
Genesis,7,22,"All on the dry land, in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died."
Genesis,7,23,"Every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were destroyed from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship."
Genesis,7,24,The waters flooded the earth one hundred fifty days.
Genesis,8,1,"God remembered Noah, all the animals, and all the livestock that were with him in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth. The waters subsided."
Genesis,8,2,"The deep’s fountains and the sky’s windows were also stopped, and the rain from the sky was restrained."
Genesis,8,3,The waters continually receded from the earth. After the end of one hundred fifty days the waters decreased.
Genesis,8,4,"The ship rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on Ararat’s mountains."
Genesis,8,5,"The waters receded continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were visible."
Genesis,8,6,"At the end of forty days, Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made,"
Genesis,8,7,"and he sent out a raven. It went back and forth, until the waters were dried up from the earth."
Genesis,8,8,"He himself sent out a dove to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground,"
Genesis,8,9,"but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned into the ship to him, for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth. He put out his hand, and took her, and brought her to him into the ship."
Genesis,8,10,He waited yet another seven days; and again he sent the dove out of the ship.
Genesis,8,11,"The dove came back to him at evening and, behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth."
Genesis,8,12,"He waited yet another seven days, and sent out the dove; and she didn’t return to him anymore."
Genesis,8,13,"In the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of the ship, and looked. He saw that the surface of the ground was dried."
Genesis,8,14,"In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry."
Genesis,8,15,"God spoke to Noah, saying,"
Genesis,8,16,"“Go out of the ship, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives with you."
Genesis,8,17,"Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth.”"
Genesis,8,18,"Noah went out, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives with him."
Genesis,8,19,"Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship."
Genesis,8,20,"Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar."
Genesis,8,21,"Yahweh smelled the pleasant aroma. Yahweh said in his heart, “I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake because the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth. I will never again strike every living thing, as I have done."
Genesis,8,22,"While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night will not cease.”"
Genesis,9,1,"God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth."
Genesis,9,2,"The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky. Everything that moves along the ground, and all the fish of the sea, are delivered into your hand."
Genesis,9,3,"Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. As I gave you the green herb, I have given everything to you."
Genesis,9,4,"But flesh with its life, that is, its blood, you shall not eat."
Genesis,9,5,"I will surely require your life’s blood. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, I will require the life of man."
Genesis,9,6,"Whoever sheds man’s blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man in his own image."
Genesis,9,7,"Be fruitful and multiply. Increase abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it.”"
Genesis,9,8,"God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,"
Genesis,9,9,"“As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your offspring after you,"
Genesis,9,10,"and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth."
Genesis,9,11,I will establish my covenant with you: All flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood. There will never again be a flood to destroy the earth.”
Genesis,9,12,"God said, “This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:"
Genesis,9,13,"I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be a sign of a covenant between me and the earth."
Genesis,9,14,"When I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,"
Genesis,9,15,"I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh."
Genesis,9,16,"The rainbow will be in the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.”"
Genesis,9,17,"God said to Noah, “This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.”"
Genesis,9,18,"The sons of Noah who went out from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the father of Canaan."
Genesis,9,19,"These three were the sons of Noah, and from these, the whole earth was populated."
Genesis,9,20,"Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard."
Genesis,9,21,He drank of the wine and got drunk. He was uncovered within his tent.
Genesis,9,22,"Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside."
Genesis,9,23,"Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backwards, and they didn’t see their father’s nakedness."
Genesis,9,24,"Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to him."
Genesis,9,25,"He said, “Canaan is cursed. He will be a servant of servants to his brothers.”"
Genesis,9,26,"He said, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem. Let Canaan be his servant."
Genesis,9,27,May God enlarge Japheth. Let him dwell in the tents of Shem. Let Canaan be his servant.”
Genesis,9,28,Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood.
Genesis,9,29,"All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years, and then he died."
Genesis,10,1,"Now this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood."
Genesis,10,2,"The sons of Japheth were: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras."
Genesis,10,3,"The sons of Gomer were: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah."
Genesis,10,4,"The sons of Javan were: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim."
Genesis,10,5,"Of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands, everyone after his language, after their families, in their nations."
Genesis,10,6,"The sons of Ham were: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan."
Genesis,10,7,"The sons of Cush were: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah were: Sheba and Dedan."
Genesis,10,8,Cush became the father of Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth.
Genesis,10,9,"He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh. Therefore it is said, “like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Yahweh”."
Genesis,10,10,"The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."
Genesis,10,11,"Out of that land he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,"
Genesis,10,12,and Resen between Nineveh and the great city Calah.
Genesis,10,13,"Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,"
Genesis,10,14,"Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from), and Caphtorim."
Genesis,10,15,"Canaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth,"
Genesis,10,16,"the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,"
Genesis,10,17,"the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,"
Genesis,10,18,"the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad."
Genesis,10,19,"The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon—as you go toward Gerar—to Gaza—as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim—to Lasha."
Genesis,10,20,"These are the sons of Ham, after their families, according to their languages, in their lands and their nations."
Genesis,10,21,"Children were also born to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth."
Genesis,10,22,"The sons of Shem were: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram."
Genesis,10,23,"The sons of Aram were: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash."
Genesis,10,24,Arpachshad became the father of Shelah. Shelah became the father of Eber.
Genesis,10,25,"To Eber were born two sons. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. His brother’s name was Joktan."
Genesis,10,26,"Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,"
Genesis,10,27,"Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,"
Genesis,10,28,"Obal, Abimael, Sheba,"
Genesis,10,29,"Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan."
Genesis,10,30,"Their dwelling extended from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east."
Genesis,10,31,"These are the sons of Shem, by their families, according to their languages, lands, and nations."
Genesis,10,32,"These are the families of the sons of Noah, by their generations, according to their nations. The nations divided from these in the earth after the flood."
Genesis,11,1,The whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
Genesis,11,2,"As they traveled from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there."
Genesis,11,3,"They said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar."
Genesis,11,4,"They said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let’s make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth.”"
Genesis,11,5,"Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built."
Genesis,11,6,"Yahweh said, “Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do."
Genesis,11,7,"Come, let’s go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.”"
Genesis,11,8,So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city.
Genesis,11,9,"Therefore its name was called Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth. From there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth."
Genesis,11,10,This is the history of the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old when he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood.
Genesis,11,11,"Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and became the father of more sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,12,Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah.

Genesis,11,18,"Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu."
Genesis,11,19,"Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father of Reu, and became the father of more sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,20,"Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug."
Genesis,11,21,"Reu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father of Serug, and became the father of more sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,22,"Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor."
Genesis,11,23,"Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and became the father of more sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,24,"Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah."
Genesis,11,25,"Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and became the father of more sons and daughters."
Genesis,11,26,"Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
Genesis,11,27,"Now this is the history of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the father of Lot."
Genesis,11,28,"Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees."
Genesis,11,29,"Abram and Nahor married wives. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran who was also the father of Iscah."
Genesis,11,30,Sarai was barren. She had no child.
Genesis,11,31,"Terah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife. They went from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived there."
Genesis,11,32,The days of Terah were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran.
Genesis,12,1,"Now Yahweh said to Abram, “Leave your country, and your relatives, and your father’s house, and go to the land that I will show you."
Genesis,12,2,I will make of you a great nation. I will bless you and make your name great. You will be a blessing.
Genesis,12,3,"I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who treates you with contempt. All the families of the earth will be blessed through you.”"
Genesis,12,4,"So Abram went, as Yahweh had told him. Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran."
Genesis,12,5,"Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother’s son, all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people whom they had acquired in Haran, and they went to go into the land of Canaan. They entered into the land of Canaan."
Genesis,12,6,"Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time, Canaanites were in the land."
Genesis,12,7,"Yahweh appeared to Abram and said, “I will give this land to your offspring.” He built an altar there to Yahweh, who had appeared to him."
Genesis,12,8,"He left from there to go to the mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to Yahweh and called on Yahweh’s name."
Genesis,12,9,"Abram traveled, still going on toward the South."
Genesis,12,10,"There was a famine in the land. Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe in the land."
Genesis,12,11,"When he had come near to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “See now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at."
Genesis,12,12,"It will happen, when the Egyptians see you, that they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ They will kill me, but they will save you alive."
Genesis,12,13,"Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you.”"
Genesis,12,14,"When Abram had come into Egypt, Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful."
Genesis,12,15,"The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house."
Genesis,12,16,"He dealt well with Abram for her sake. He had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels."
Genesis,12,17,"Yahweh afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife."
Genesis,12,18,"Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this that you have done to me? Why didn’t you tell me that she was your wife?"
Genesis,12,19,"Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore, see your wife, take her, and go your way.”"
Genesis,12,20,"Pharaoh commanded men concerning him, and they escorted him away with his wife and all that he had."
Genesis,13,1,"Abram went up out of Egypt—he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him—into the South."
Genesis,13,2,"Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold."
Genesis,13,3,"He went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,"
Genesis,13,4,"to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. There Abram called on Yahweh’s name."
Genesis,13,5,"Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, herds, and tents."
Genesis,13,6,"The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together; for their substance was great, so that they could not live together."
Genesis,13,7,There was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites lived in the land at that time.
Genesis,13,8,"Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen; for we are relatives."
Genesis,13,9,"Isn’t the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left.”"
Genesis,13,10,"Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar."
Genesis,13,11,"So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves the one from the other."
Genesis,13,12,"Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom."
Genesis,13,13,Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh.
Genesis,13,14,"Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, “Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,"
Genesis,13,15,"for all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to your offspring forever."
Genesis,13,16,"I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can count the dust of the earth, then your offspring may also be counted."
Genesis,13,17,"Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its width; for I will give it to you.”"
Genesis,13,18,"Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh."
Genesis,14,1,"In the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch, king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim,"
Genesis,14,2,"they made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha, king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah, and Shemeber, king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also called Zoar)."
Genesis,14,3,All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (also called the Salt Sea).
Genesis,14,4,"They served Chedorlaomer for twelve years, and in the thirteenth year, they rebelled."
Genesis,14,5,"In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came, and the kings who were with him, and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,"
Genesis,14,6,"and the Horites in their Mount Seir, to El Paran, which is by the wilderness."
Genesis,14,7,"They returned, and came to En Mishpat (also called Kadesh), and struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that lived in Hazazon Tamar."
Genesis,14,8,"The king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also called Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in array against them in the valley of Siddim;"
Genesis,14,9,"against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five."
Genesis,14,10,"Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and some fell there, and those who remained fled to the hills."
Genesis,14,11,"They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way."
Genesis,14,12,"They took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed."
Genesis,14,13,"One who had escaped came and told Abram, the Hebrew. At that time, he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and they were allies of Abram."
Genesis,14,14,"When Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he led out his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan."
Genesis,14,15,"He divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus."
Genesis,14,16,"He brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative, Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the other people."
Genesis,14,17,"The king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley)."
Genesis,14,18,Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High.
Genesis,14,19,"He blessed him, and said, “Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:"
Genesis,14,20,"and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand.” Abram gave him a tenth of all."
Genesis,14,21,"The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people, and take the goods for yourself.”"
Genesis,14,22,"Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted up my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,"
Genesis,14,23,"that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’"
Genesis,14,24,"I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion.”"
Genesis,15,1,"After these things Yahweh’s word came to Abram in a vision, saying, “Don’t be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.”"
Genesis,15,2,"Abram said, “Lord Yahweh, what will you give me, since I go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?”"
Genesis,15,3,"Abram said, “Behold, to me you have given no children: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir.”"
Genesis,15,4,"Behold, Yahweh’s word came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir, but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir.”"
Genesis,15,5,"Yahweh brought him outside, and said, “Look now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” He said to Abram, “So will your offspring be.”"
Genesis,15,6,"He believed in Yahweh, who credited it to him for righteousness."
Genesis,15,7,"He said to Abram, “I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.”"
Genesis,15,8,"He said, “Lord Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?”"
Genesis,15,9,"He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”"
Genesis,15,10,"He brought him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he didn’t divide the birds."
Genesis,15,11,"The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away."
Genesis,15,12,"When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and great darkness fell on him."
Genesis,15,13,"He said to Abram, “Know for sure that your offspring will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four hundred years."
Genesis,15,14,"I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with great wealth,"
Genesis,15,15,but you will go to your fathers in peace. You will be buried at a good old age.
Genesis,15,16,"In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.”"
Genesis,15,17,"It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch passed between these pieces."
Genesis,15,18,"In that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram, saying, “I have given this land to your offspring, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:"
Genesis,15,19,"the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,"
Genesis,15,20,"the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,"
Genesis,15,21,"the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”"
Leviticus,15,1,"Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,"
Leviticus,15,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When any man has a discharge from his body, because of his discharge he is unclean."
Leviticus,15,3,"This shall be his uncleanness in his discharge: whether his body runs with his discharge, or his body has stopped from his discharge, it is his uncleanness."
Leviticus,15,4,“‘Every bed whereon he who has the discharge lies shall be unclean; and everything he sits on shall be unclean.
Leviticus,15,5,"Whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,6,"He who sits on anything whereon the man who has the discharge sat shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,7,"“‘He who touches the body of him who has the discharge shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,8,"“‘If he who has the discharge spits on him who is clean, then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,9,“‘Whatever saddle he who has the discharge rides on shall be unclean.
Leviticus,15,10,"Whoever touches anything that was under him shall be unclean until the evening. He who carries those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,11,"“‘Whoever he who has the discharge touches, without having rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,12,"“‘The earthen vessel, which he who has the discharge touches, shall be broken; and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water."
Leviticus,15,13,"“‘When he who has a discharge is cleansed of his discharge, then he shall count to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes; and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean."
Leviticus,15,14,"“‘On the eighth day he shall take two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and come before Yahweh to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and give them to the priest:"
Leviticus,15,15,"and the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering. The priest shall make atonement for him before Yahweh for his discharge."
Leviticus,15,16,"“‘If any man has an emission of semen, then he shall bathe all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,17,"Every garment, and every skin, whereon the semen is, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,18,"If a man lies with a woman and there is an emission of semen, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,19,"“‘If a woman has a discharge, and her discharge in her flesh is blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days: and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,20,“‘Everything that she lies on in her impurity shall be unclean. Everything also that she sits on shall be unclean.
Leviticus,15,21,"Whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,22,"Whoever touches anything that she sits on shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,23,"If it is on the bed, or on anything whereon she sits, when he touches it, he shall be unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,24,"“‘If any man lies with her, and her monthly flow is on him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed whereon he lies shall be unclean."
Leviticus,15,25,"“‘If a woman has a discharge of her blood many days not in the time of her period, or if she has a discharge beyond the time of her period; all the days of the discharge of her uncleanness shall be as in the days of her period: she is unclean."
Leviticus,15,26,"Every bed whereon she lies all the days of her discharge shall be to her as the bed of her period: and everything whereon she sits shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her period."
Leviticus,15,27,"Whoever touches these things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening."
Leviticus,15,28,"“‘But if she is cleansed of her discharge, then she shall count to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean."
Leviticus,15,29,"On the eighth day she shall take two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and bring them to the priest, to the door of the Tent of Meeting."
Leviticus,15,30,"The priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her before Yahweh for the uncleanness of her discharge."
Leviticus,15,31,"“‘Thus you shall separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness, so they will not die in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is among them.’”"
Leviticus,15,32,"This is the law of him who has a discharge, and of him who has an emission of semen, so that he is unclean thereby;"
Leviticus,15,33,"and of her who has her period, and of a man or woman who has a discharge, and of him who lies with her who is unclean."
Leviticus,16,1,"Yahweh spoke to Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they came near before Yahweh, and died;"
Leviticus,16,2,"and Yahweh said to Moses, “Tell Aaron your brother, not to come at all times into the Most Holy Place within the veil, before the mercy seat which is on the ark; lest he die: for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat."
Leviticus,16,3,"“Aaron shall come into the sanctuary with a young bull for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering."
Leviticus,16,4,"He shall put on the holy linen coat. He shall have the linen breeches on his body, and shall put on the linen sash, and he shall be clothed with the linen turban. They are the holy garments. He shall bathe his body in water, and put them on."
Leviticus,16,5,"He shall take from the congregation of the children of Israel two male goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering."
Leviticus,16,6,"“Aaron shall offer the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his house."
Leviticus,16,7,"He shall take the two goats, and set them before Yahweh at the door of the Tent of Meeting."
Leviticus,16,8,"Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats; one lot for Yahweh, and the other lot for the scapegoat."
Leviticus,16,9,"Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for Yahweh, and offer him for a sin offering."
Leviticus,16,10,"But the goat on which the lot fell for the scapegoat shall be presented alive before Yahweh, to make atonement for him, to send him away as the scapegoat into the wilderness."
Leviticus,16,11,"“Aaron shall present the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house, and shall kill the bull of the sin offering which is for himself."
Leviticus,16,12,"He shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Yahweh, and two handfuls of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:"
Leviticus,16,13,"and he shall put the incense on the fire before Yahweh, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is on the testimony, so that he will not die."
Leviticus,16,14,"He shall take some of the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat on the east; and before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times."
Leviticus,16,15,"“Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat."
Leviticus,16,16,"He shall make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins; and so he shall do for the Tent of Meeting, that dwells with them in the middle of their uncleanness."
Leviticus,16,17,"No one shall be in the Tent of Meeting when he enters to make atonement in the Holy Place, until he comes out, and has made atonement for himself and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel."
Leviticus,16,18,"“He shall go out to the altar that is before Yahweh and make atonement for it, and shall take some of the bull’s blood, and some of the goat’s blood, and put it around on the horns of the altar."
Leviticus,16,19,"He shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and make it holy from the uncleanness of the children of Israel."
Leviticus,16,20,"“When he has finished atoning for the Holy Place, the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat."
Leviticus,16,21,"Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them on the head of the goat, and shall send him away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who is in readiness."
Leviticus,16,22,"The goat shall carry all their iniquities on himself to a solitary land, and he shall release the goat in the wilderness."
Leviticus,16,23,"“Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and shall take off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the Holy Place, and shall leave them there."
Leviticus,16,24,"Then he shall bathe himself in water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and come out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people."
Leviticus,16,25,The fat of the sin offering he shall burn on the altar.
Leviticus,16,26,"“He who lets the goat go as the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp."

Leviticus,16,28,"He who burns them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp."
Leviticus,16,29,"“It shall be a statute to you forever: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and shall do no kind of work, the native-born, or the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you:"

Leviticus,16,32,"The priest, who is anointed and who is consecrated to be priest in his father’s place, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments."
Leviticus,16,33,Then he shall make atonement for the Holy Sanctuary; and he shall make atonement for the Tent of Meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
Leviticus,16,34,"“This shall be an everlasting statute for you, to make atonement for the children of Israel once in the year because of all their sins.” It was done as Yahweh commanded Moses."

Leviticus,17,10,"“‘Any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them, who eats any kind of blood, I will set my face against that soul who eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people."
Leviticus,17,11,For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life.
Leviticus,17,12,"Therefore I have said to the children of Israel, “No person among you may eat blood, nor may any stranger who lives as a foreigner among you eat blood.”"
Leviticus,17,13,"“‘Whatever man there is of the children of Israel, or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them, who takes in hunting any animal or bird that may be eaten; he shall pour out its blood, and cover it with dust."

Leviticus,17,15,"“‘Every person that eats what dies of itself, or that which is torn by animals, whether he is native-born or a foreigner, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening: then he shall be clean."

Leviticus,23,10,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you have come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap its harvest, then you shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest:"
Leviticus,23,11,"and he shall wave the sheaf before Yahweh, to be accepted for you. On the next day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it."
Leviticus,23,12,"On the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb without defect a year old for a burnt offering to Yahweh."
Leviticus,23,13,"The meal offering with it shall be two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire to Yahweh for a pleasant aroma; and the drink offering with it shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin."
Leviticus,23,14,"You must not eat bread, or roasted grain, or fresh grain, until this same day, until you have brought the offering of your God. This is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings."
Leviticus,23,15,"“‘You shall count from the next day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven Sabbaths shall be completed:"
Leviticus,23,16,even to the next day after the seventh Sabbath you shall count fifty days; and you shall offer a new meal offering to Yahweh.
Leviticus,23,17,"You shall bring out of your habitations two loaves of bread for a wave offering made of two tenths of an ephah of fine flour. They shall be baked with yeast, for first fruits to Yahweh."
Leviticus,23,18,"You shall present with the bread seven lambs without defect a year old, one young bull, and two rams. They shall be a burnt offering to Yahweh, with their meal offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet aroma to Yahweh."
Leviticus,23,19,"You shall offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace offerings."
Leviticus,23,20,"The priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before Yahweh, with the two lambs. They shall be holy to Yahweh for the priest."
Leviticus,23,21,You shall make proclamation on the same day: there shall be a holy convocation to you; you shall do no regular work. This is a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
Leviticus,23,22,"“‘When you reap the harvest of your land, you must not wholly reap into the corners of your field, and you must not gather the gleanings of your harvest. You must leave them for the poor, and for the foreigner. I am Yahweh your God.’”"
Leviticus,23,23,"Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,23,24,"“Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest to you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation."
Leviticus,23,25,You shall do no regular work; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh.’”
Leviticus,23,26,"Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,23,27,"“However on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be a holy convocation to you, and you shall afflict yourselves; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh."
Leviticus,23,28,"You shall do no kind of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before Yahweh your God."
Leviticus,23,29,For whoever it is who shall not deny himself in that same day; shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus,23,30,"Whoever it is who does any kind of work in that same day, that person I will destroy from among his people."
Leviticus,23,31,You shall do no kind of work: it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Leviticus,23,32,"It shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for you, and you shall deny yourselves. In the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall keep your Sabbath.”"
Leviticus,23,33,"Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,23,34,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and say, ‘On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tents for seven days to Yahweh."
Leviticus,23,35,On the first day shall be a holy convocation: you shall do no regular work.
Leviticus,23,36,Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh. On the eighth day shall be a holy convocation to you; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh. It is a solemn assembly; you shall do no regular work.
Leviticus,23,37,"“‘These are the appointed feasts of Yahweh, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering, and a meal offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, each on its own day—"
Leviticus,23,38,"besides the Sabbaths of Yahweh, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill offerings, which you give to Yahweh."
Leviticus,23,39,"“‘So on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruits of the land, you shall keep the feast of Yahweh seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest."
Leviticus,23,40,"You shall take on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God seven days."
Leviticus,23,41,You shall keep it as a feast to Yahweh seven days in the year. It is a statute forever throughout your generations. You shall keep it in the seventh month.
Leviticus,23,42,"You shall dwell in temporary shelters for seven days. All who are native-born in Israel shall dwell in temporary shelters,"
Leviticus,23,43,"that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in temporary shelters, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.’”"
Leviticus,23,44,Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed feasts of Yahweh.
Leviticus,24,1,"Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,24,2,"“Command the children of Israel, that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually."
Leviticus,24,3,"Outside of the veil of the Testimony, in the Tent of Meeting, shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before Yahweh continually: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations."
Leviticus,24,4,He shall keep in order the lamps on the pure gold lamp stand before Yahweh continually.
Leviticus,24,5,"“You shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it: two tenths of an ephah shall be in one cake."
Leviticus,24,6,"You shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure gold table before Yahweh."
Leviticus,24,7,"You shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to Yahweh."
Leviticus,24,8,Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before Yahweh continually. It is an everlasting covenant on the behalf of the children of Israel.
Leviticus,24,9,It shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy to him of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire by a perpetual statute.”
Leviticus,24,10,"The son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp."
Leviticus,24,11,"The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him to Moses. His mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan."
Leviticus,24,12,"They put him in custody, until Yahweh’s will should be declared to them."
Leviticus,24,13,"Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,24,14,"“Bring out of the camp him who cursed; and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him."
Leviticus,24,15,"You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin."
Leviticus,24,16,"He who blasphemes Yahweh’s name, he shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall certainly stone him. The foreigner as well as the native-born, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death."
Leviticus,24,17,“‘He who strikes any man mortally shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus,24,18,"He who strikes an animal mortally shall make it good, life for life."
Leviticus,24,19,"If anyone injures his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him:"
Leviticus,24,20,"fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he has injured someone, so shall it be done to him."
Leviticus,24,21,He who kills an animal shall make it good; and he who kills a man shall be put to death.
Leviticus,24,22,You shall have one kind of law for the foreigner as well as the native-born; for I am Yahweh your God.’”
Leviticus,24,23,"Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they brought him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. The children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses."
Leviticus,25,1,"Yahweh said to Moses in Mount Sinai,"
Leviticus,25,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you come into the land which I give you, then the land shall keep a Sabbath to Yahweh."
Leviticus,25,3,"You shall sow your field six years, and you shall prune your vineyard six years, and gather in its fruits;"
Leviticus,25,4,"but in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a Sabbath to Yahweh. You shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard."
Leviticus,25,5,"What grows of itself in your harvest you shall not reap, and you shall not gather the grapes of your undressed vine. It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land."
Leviticus,25,6,"The Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for yourself, for your servant, for your maid, for your hired servant, and for your stranger, who lives as a foreigner with you."
Leviticus,25,7,"For your livestock also, and for the animals that are in your land, shall all its increase be for food."
Leviticus,25,8,"“‘You shall count off seven Sabbaths of years, seven times seven years; and there shall be to you the days of seven Sabbaths of years, even forty-nine years."
Leviticus,25,9,Then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. On the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land.
Leviticus,25,10,"You shall make the fiftieth year holy, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee to you; and each of you shall return to his own property, and each of you shall return to his family."
Leviticus,25,11,"That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you. In it you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself, nor gather from the undressed vines."
Leviticus,25,12,For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat of its increase out of the field.
Leviticus,25,13,“‘In this Year of Jubilee each of you shall return to his property.
Leviticus,25,14,"“‘If you sell anything to your neighbor, or buy from your neighbor, you shall not wrong one another."
Leviticus,25,15,According to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor. According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you.
Leviticus,25,16,"According to the length of the years you shall increase its price, and according to the shortness of the years you shall diminish its price; for he is selling the number of the crops to you."
Leviticus,25,17,You shall not wrong one another; but you shall fear your God: for I am Yahweh your God.
Leviticus,25,18,"“‘Therefore you shall do my statutes, and keep my ordinances and do them; and you shall dwell in the land in safety."
Leviticus,25,19,"The land shall yield its fruit, and you shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety."
Leviticus,25,20,"If you said, “What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase”;"
Leviticus,25,21,"then I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall bear fruit for the three years."
Leviticus,25,22,"You shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in, you shall eat the old store."
Leviticus,25,23,"“‘The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine; for you are strangers and live as foreigners with me."
Leviticus,25,24,In all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption for the land.
Leviticus,25,25,"“‘If your brother becomes poor, and sells some of his possessions, then his kinsman who is next to him shall come, and redeem that which his brother has sold."
Leviticus,25,26,"If a man has no one to redeem it, and he becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem it;"
Leviticus,25,27,"then let him reckon the years since its sale, and restore the surplus to the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return to his property."
Leviticus,25,28,"But if he isn’t able to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the hand of him who has bought it until the Year of Jubilee: and in the Jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return to his property."
Leviticus,25,29,"“‘If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it has been sold. For a full year he shall have the right of redemption."
Leviticus,25,30,"If it isn’t redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations. It shall not be released in the Jubilee."
Leviticus,25,31,"But the houses of the villages which have no wall around them shall be accounted for with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the Jubilee."
Leviticus,25,32,"“‘Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses in the cities of their possession, the Levites may redeem at any time."
Leviticus,25,33,"The Levites may redeem the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, and it shall be released in the Jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel."
Leviticus,25,34,But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
Leviticus,25,35,"“‘If your brother has become poor, and his hand can’t support himself among you; then you shall uphold him. He shall live with you like an alien and a temporary resident."
Leviticus,25,36,"Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God; that your brother may live among you."
Leviticus,25,37,"You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit."
Leviticus,25,38,"I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God."
Leviticus,25,39,"“‘If your brother has grown poor among you, and sells himself to you; you shall not make him to serve as a slave."
Leviticus,25,40,"As a hired servant, and as a temporary resident, he shall be with you; he shall serve with you until the Year of Jubilee:"
Leviticus,25,41,"then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and shall return to his own family, and to the possession of his fathers."
Leviticus,25,42,"For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. They shall not be sold as slaves."
Leviticus,25,43,"You shall not rule over him with harshness, but shall fear your God."
Leviticus,25,44,"“‘As for your male and your female slaves, whom you may have; of the nations that are around you, from them you may buy male and female slaves."
Leviticus,25,45,"Moreover of the children of the aliens who live among you, of them you may buy, and of their families who are with you, which they have conceived in your land; and they will be your property."
Leviticus,25,46,"You may make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them may you take your slaves forever; but over your brothers the children of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, with harshness."
Leviticus,25,47,"“‘If an alien or temporary resident with you becomes rich, and your brother beside him has grown poor, and sells himself to the stranger or foreigner living among you, or to a member of the stranger’s family;"
Leviticus,25,48,after he is sold he may be redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him;
Leviticus,25,49,"or his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or any who is a close relative to him of his family may redeem him; or if he has grown rich, he may redeem himself."
Leviticus,25,50,He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the Year of Jubilee. The price of his sale shall be according to the number of years; he shall be with him according to the time of a hired servant.
Leviticus,25,51,"If there are yet many years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for."
Leviticus,25,52,"If there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according to his years of service he shall give back the price of his redemption."
Leviticus,25,53,As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him. He shall not rule with harshness over him in your sight.
Leviticus,25,54,"If he isn’t redeemed by these means, then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee, he, and his children with him."
Leviticus,25,55,For to me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.
Leviticus,26,1,"“‘You shall make for yourselves no idols, and you shall not raise up a carved image or a pillar, and you shall not place any figured stone in your land, to bow down to it; for I am Yahweh your God."
Leviticus,26,2,"“‘You shall keep my Sabbaths, and have reverence for my sanctuary. I am Yahweh."
Leviticus,26,3,"“‘If you walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;"
Leviticus,26,4,"then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit."
Leviticus,26,5,"Your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time. You shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely."
Leviticus,26,6,"“‘I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and no one will make you afraid. I will remove evil animals out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land."
Leviticus,26,7,"You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword."
Leviticus,26,8,"Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword."
Leviticus,26,9,"“‘I will have respect for you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you."
Leviticus,26,10,"You shall eat old store long kept, and you shall move out the old because of the new."
Leviticus,26,11,"I will set my tent among you, and my soul won’t abhor you."
Leviticus,26,12,"I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you will be my people."
Leviticus,26,13,"I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves. I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright."
Leviticus,26,14,"“‘But if you will not listen to me, and will not do all these commandments;"
Leviticus,26,15,"and if you shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhors my ordinances, so that you will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;"
Leviticus,26,16,"I also will do this to you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away. You will sow your seed in vain, for your enemies will eat it."
Leviticus,26,17,"I will set my face against you, and you will be struck before your enemies. Those who hate you will rule over you; and you will flee when no one pursues you."
Leviticus,26,18,"“‘If you in spite of these things will not listen to me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins."
Leviticus,26,19,"I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your sky like iron, and your soil like brass."
Leviticus,26,20,"Your strength will be spent in vain; for your land won’t yield its increase, neither will the trees of the land yield their fruit."
Leviticus,26,21,"“‘If you walk contrary to me, and won’t listen to me, then I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins."
Leviticus,26,22,"I will send the wild animals among you, which will rob you of your children, destroy your livestock, and make you few in number. Your roads will become desolate."
Leviticus,26,23,"“‘If by these things you won’t be reformed to me, but will walk contrary to me;"
Leviticus,26,24,"then I will also walk contrary to you; and I will strike you, even I, seven times for your sins."
Leviticus,26,25,"I will bring a sword upon you that will execute the vengeance of the covenant. You will be gathered together within your cities, and I will send the pestilence among you. You will be delivered into the hand of the enemy."
Leviticus,26,26,"When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight. You shall eat, and not be satisfied."
Leviticus,26,27,"“‘If you in spite of this won’t listen to me, but walk contrary to me;"
Leviticus,26,28,then I will walk contrary to you in wrath. I will also chastise you seven times for your sins.
Leviticus,26,29,"You will eat the flesh of your sons, and you will eat the flesh of your daughters."
Leviticus,26,30,"I will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul will abhor you."
Leviticus,26,31,"I will lay your cities waste, and will bring your sanctuaries to desolation. I will not take delight in the sweet fragrance of your offerings."
Leviticus,26,32,I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein will be astonished at it.
Leviticus,26,33,"I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you. Your land will be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste."
Leviticus,26,34,Then the land will enjoy its Sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in your enemies’ land. Even then the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths.
Leviticus,26,35,"As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it didn’t have in your Sabbaths, when you lived on it."
Leviticus,26,36,"“‘As for those of you who are left, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. The sound of a driven leaf will put them to flight; and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword. They will fall when no one pursues."
Leviticus,26,37,"They will stumble over one another, as it were before the sword, when no one pursues. You will have no power to stand before your enemies."
Leviticus,26,38,You will perish among the nations. The land of your enemies will eat you up.
Leviticus,26,39,Those of you who are left will pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers they shall pine away with them.
Leviticus,26,40,"“‘If they confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary to me,"
Leviticus,26,41,"I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity;"
Leviticus,26,42,"then I will remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham; and I will remember the land."
Leviticus,26,43,"The land also will be left by them, and will enjoy its Sabbaths while it lies desolate without them: and they will accept the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes."
Leviticus,26,44,"Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God;"
Leviticus,26,45,"but I will for their sake remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am Yahweh.’”"
Leviticus,26,46,"These are the statutes, ordinances and laws, which Yahweh made between him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses."
Leviticus,27,1,"Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,"
Leviticus,27,2,"“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, ‘When a man consecrates a person to Yahweh in a vow, according to your valuation,"
Leviticus,27,3,"your valuation of a male from twenty years old even to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary."
Leviticus,27,4,"If she is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels."
Leviticus,27,5,"If the person is from five years old even to twenty years old, then your valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels."
Leviticus,27,6,"If the person is from a month old even to five years old, then your valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver, and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver."
Leviticus,27,7,"If the person is from sixty years old and upward; if he is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels."
Leviticus,27,8,"But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall assign a value to him. The priest shall assign a value according to his ability to pay."
Leviticus,27,9,"“‘If it is an animal, of which men offer an offering to Yahweh, all that any man gives of such to Yahweh becomes holy."
Leviticus,27,10,"He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy."
Leviticus,27,11,"If it is any unclean animal, of which they do not offer as an offering to Yahweh, then he shall set the animal before the priest;"
Leviticus,27,12,"and the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad. As you the priest values it, so shall it be."
Leviticus,27,13,"But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to its valuation."
Leviticus,27,14,"“‘When a man dedicates his house to be holy to Yahweh, then the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad: as the priest shall evaluate it, so shall it stand."
Leviticus,27,15,"If he who dedicates it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be his."
Leviticus,27,16,"“‘If a man dedicates to Yahweh part of the field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it. The sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver."
Leviticus,27,17,"If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand."
Leviticus,27,18,"But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the Year of Jubilee; and an abatement shall be made from your valuation."
Leviticus,27,19,"If he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall remain his."
Leviticus,27,20,"If he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more;"
Leviticus,27,21,"but the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy to Yahweh, as a devoted field. It shall be owned by the priests."
Leviticus,27,22,"“‘If he dedicates a field to Yahweh which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession,"
Leviticus,27,23,"then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to the Year of Jubilee; and he shall give your valuation on that day, as a holy thing to Yahweh."
Leviticus,27,24,"In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs."
Leviticus,27,25,All your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs to the shekel.
Leviticus,27,26,"“‘Only the firstborn among animals, which is made Yahweh’s firstborn, no man may dedicate; whether an ox or a sheep. It is Yahweh’s."
Leviticus,27,27,"If it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back according to your valuation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it; or if it isn’t redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation."
Leviticus,27,28,"“‘Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to Yahweh of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed. Everything devoted to destruction is most holy to Yahweh."
Leviticus,27,29,"“‘No one devoted, who shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death."
Leviticus,27,30,"“‘All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is Yahweh’s. It is holy to Yahweh."
Leviticus,27,31,"If a man redeems anything of his tithe, he shall add a fifth part to it."
Leviticus,27,32,"All the tithe of the herds or the flocks, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to Yahweh."
Leviticus,27,33,"He shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it. If he changes it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy. It shall not be redeemed.’”"

2 Samuel,7,1,"When the king lived in his house, and Yahweh had given him rest from all his enemies all around,"
2 Samuel,7,2,"the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but God’s ark dwells within curtains.”"
2 Samuel,7,3,"Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that is in your heart; for Yahweh is with you.”"
2 Samuel,7,4,"That same night, Yahweh’s word came to Nathan, saying,"
2 Samuel,7,5,"“Go and tell my servant David, ‘Yahweh says, “Should you build me a house for me to dwell in?"
2 Samuel,7,6,"For I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought the children of Israel up out of Egypt, even to this day, but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle."
2 Samuel,7,7,"In all places in which I have walked with all the children of Israel, did I say a word to any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’”’"
2 Samuel,7,8,"Now therefore tell my servant David this, ‘Yahweh of Armies says, “I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people, over Israel."
2 Samuel,7,9,"I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth."
2 Samuel,7,10,"I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more. The children of wickedness will not afflict them any more, as at the first,"
2 Samuel,7,11,and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will cause you to rest from all your enemies. Moreover Yahweh tells you that Yahweh will make you a house.
2 Samuel,7,12,"When your days are fulfilled, and you sleep with your fathers, I will set up your offspring after you, who will proceed out of your body, and I will establish his kingdom."
2 Samuel,7,13,"He will build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever."
2 Samuel,7,14,"I will be his father, and he will be my son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men;"
2 Samuel,7,15,"but my loving kindness will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you."
2 Samuel,7,16,Your house and your kingdom will be made sure forever before you. Your throne will be established forever.”’”
2 Samuel,7,17,"Nathan spoke to David all these words, and according to all this vision."
2 Samuel,7,18,"Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, “Who am I, Lord Yahweh, and what is my house, that you have brought me this far?"
2 Samuel,7,19,"This was yet a small thing in your eyes, Lord Yahweh; but you have spoken also of your servant’s house for a great while to come; and this among men, Lord Yahweh!"
2 Samuel,7,20,"What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, Lord Yahweh."
2 Samuel,7,21,"For your word’s sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make your servant know it."
2 Samuel,7,22,"Therefore you are great, Yahweh God. For there is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears."
2 Samuel,7,23,"What one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, and to make himself a name, and to do great things for you, and awesome things for your land, before your people, whom you redeemed to yourself out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods?"
2 Samuel,7,24,"You established for yourself your people Israel to be your people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God."
2 Samuel,7,25,"Now, Yahweh God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, confirm it forever, and do as you have spoken."
2 Samuel,7,26,"Let your name be magnified forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies is God over Israel; and the house of your servant David will be established before you.’"
2 Samuel,7,27,"For you, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, ‘I will build you a house.’ Therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to you."
2 Samuel,7,28,"“Now, O Lord Yahweh, you are God, and your words are truth, and you have promised this good thing to your servant."
2 Samuel,7,29,"Now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Lord Yahweh, have spoken it. Let the house of your servant be blessed forever with your blessing.”"
2 Samuel,8,1,"After this, David struck the Philistines and subdued them; and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines."
2 Samuel,8,2,"He struck Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. The Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute."
2 Samuel,8,3,"David struck also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River."

2 Samuel,8,7,"David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,8,8,"From Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took a great quantity of brass."
2 Samuel,8,9,"When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer,"
2 Samuel,8,10,"then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him; for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. Joram brought with him vessels of silver, vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:"
2 Samuel,8,11,"King David also dedicated these to Yahweh, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued;"
2 Samuel,8,12,"of Syria, of Moab, of the children of Ammon, of the Philistines, of Amalek, and of the plunder of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah."
2 Samuel,8,13,David earned a reputation when he returned from striking down eighteen thousand men of the Syrians in the Valley of Salt.
2 Samuel,8,14,"He put garrisons in Edom. Throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went."

2 Samuel,9,1,"David said, “Is there yet any who is left of Saul’s house, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?”"
2 Samuel,9,2,"There was of Saul’s house a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?” He said, “I am your servant.”"
2 Samuel,9,3,"The king said, “Is there not yet any of Saul’s house, that I may show the kindness of God to him?” Ziba said to the king, “Jonathan still has a son, who is lame in his feet.”"
2 Samuel,9,4,"The king said to him, “Where is he?” Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo Debar.”"
2 Samuel,9,5,"Then king David sent, and brought him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar."
2 Samuel,9,6,"Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face, and showed respect. David said, “Mephibosheth.” He answered, “Behold, your servant!”"
2 Samuel,9,7,"David said to him, “Don’t be afraid; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father’s sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father. You will eat bread at my table continually.”"
2 Samuel,9,8,"He bowed down, and said, “What is your servant, that you should look at such a dead dog as I am?”"
2 Samuel,9,9,"Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, “All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master’s son."
2 Samuel,9,10,"Till the land for him, you, your sons, and your servants. Bring in the harvest, that your master’s son may have bread to eat; but Mephibosheth your master’s son will always eat bread at my table.” Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants."
2 Samuel,9,11,"Then Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so your servant will do.” So Mephibosheth ate at the king’s table, like one of the king’s sons."
2 Samuel,9,12,"Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. All that lived in Ziba’s house were servants to Mephibosheth."
2 Samuel,9,13,So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem; for he ate continually at the king’s table. He was lame in both his feet.
2 Samuel,10,1,"After this, the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place."
2 Samuel,10,2,"David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon."
2 Samuel,10,3,"But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Hasn’t David sent his servants to you to search the city, to spy it out, and to overthrow it?”"
2 Samuel,10,4,"So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved off one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away."
2 Samuel,10,5,"When they told David this, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. The king said, “Wait at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”"
2 Samuel,10,6,"When the children of Ammon saw that they had become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with one thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men."
2 Samuel,10,7,"When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men."
2 Samuel,10,8,"The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate. The Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field."
2 Samuel,10,9,"Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians."
2 Samuel,10,10,The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon.
2 Samuel,10,11,"He said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come and help you."
2 Samuel,10,12,"Be courageous, and let us be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God; and may Yahweh do what seems good to him.”"
2 Samuel,10,13,"So Joab and the people who were with him came near to the battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him."
2 Samuel,10,14,"When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,10,15,"When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together."
2 Samuel,10,16,"Hadadezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head."
2 Samuel,10,17,"David was told that; and he gathered all Israel together, passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. The Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him."
2 Samuel,10,18,"The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed seven hundred charioteers of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the captain of their army, so that he died there."
2 Samuel,10,19,"When all the kings who were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians were afraid to help the children of Ammon any more."
2 Samuel,11,1,"At the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,11,2,"At evening, David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king’s house. From the roof, he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to look at."
2 Samuel,11,3,"David sent and inquired after the woman. One said, “Isn’t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, Uriah the Hittite’s wife?”"
2 Samuel,11,4,"David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house."
2 Samuel,11,5,"The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, “I am with child.”"
2 Samuel,11,6,"David sent to Joab, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” Joab sent Uriah to David."
2 Samuel,11,7,"When Uriah had come to him, David asked him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered."
2 Samuel,11,8,"David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and a gift from the king was sent after him."
2 Samuel,11,9,"But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and didn’t go down to his house."
2 Samuel,11,10,"When they had told David, saying, “Uriah didn’t go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Haven’t you come from a journey? Why didn’t you go down to your house?”"
2 Samuel,11,11,"Uriah said to David, “The ark, Israel, and Judah, are staying in tents; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing!”"
2 Samuel,11,12,"David said to Uriah, “Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the next day."
2 Samuel,11,13,"When David had called him, he ate and drink before him; and he made him drunk. At evening, he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn’t go down to his house."
2 Samuel,11,14,"In the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah."
2 Samuel,11,15,"He wrote in the letter, saying, “Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck, and die.”"
2 Samuel,11,16,"When Joab kept watch on the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were."
2 Samuel,11,17,"The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab. Some of the people fell, even of David’s servants; and Uriah the Hittite died also."
2 Samuel,11,18,Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
2 Samuel,11,19,"and he commanded the messenger, saying, “When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king,"
2 Samuel,11,20,"it shall be that, if the king’s wrath arise, and he asks you, ‘Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn’t you know that they would shoot from the wall?"
2 Samuel,11,21,"Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn’t a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?’ then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.’”"
2 Samuel,11,22,"So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for."
2 Samuel,11,23,"The messenger said to David, “The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate."
2 Samuel,11,24,"The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king’s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.”"
2 Samuel,11,25,"Then David said to the messenger, “Tell Joab, ‘Don’t let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.’ Encourage him.”"
2 Samuel,11,26,"When Uriah’s wife heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband."
2 Samuel,11,27,"When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh."
2 Samuel,12,1,"Yahweh sent Nathan to David. He came to him, and said to him, “There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor."
2 Samuel,12,2,"The rich man had very many flocks and herds,"
2 Samuel,12,3,"but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and raised. It grew up together with him, and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was like a daughter to him."
2 Samuel,12,4,"A traveler came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to prepare for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but took the poor man’s lamb, and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”"
2 Samuel,12,5,"David’s anger burned hot against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this deserves to die!"
2 Samuel,12,6,"He must restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity!”"
2 Samuel,12,7,"Nathan said to David, “You are the man. This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul."
2 Samuel,12,8,"I gave you your master’s house, and your master’s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that would have been too little, I would have added to you many more such things."
2 Samuel,12,9,"Why have you despised Yahweh’s word, to do that which is evil in his sight? You have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon."
2 Samuel,12,10,"Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken Uriah the Hittite’s wife to be your wife.’"
2 Samuel,12,11,"“This is what Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun."
2 Samuel,12,12,"For you did this secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.’”"
2 Samuel,12,13,"David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against Yahweh.” Nathan said to David, “Yahweh also has put away your sin. You will not die."
2 Samuel,12,14,"However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to Yahweh’s enemies to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you will surely die.”"
2 Samuel,12,15,"Nathan departed to his house. Yahweh struck the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and it was very sick."
2 Samuel,12,16,"David therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the ground."
2 Samuel,12,17,"The elders of his house arose beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, and he didn’t eat bread with them."
2 Samuel,12,18,"On the seventh day, the child died. David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he didn’t listen to our voice. How will he then harm himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?”"
2 Samuel,12,19,"But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” They said, “He is dead.”"
2 Samuel,12,20,"Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothing; and he came into Yahweh’s house, and worshiped. Then he came to his own house; and when he requested, they set bread before him, and he ate."
2 Samuel,12,21,"Then his servants said to him, “What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive, but when the child was dead, you rose up and ate bread.”"
2 Samuel,12,22,"He said, “While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, ‘Who knows whether Yahweh will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?’"
2 Samuel,12,23,"But now he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.”"
2 Samuel,12,24,"David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her. She bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. Yahweh loved him;"
2 Samuel,12,25,"and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he named him Jedidiah, for Yahweh’s sake."
2 Samuel,12,26,"Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city."
2 Samuel,12,27,"Joab sent messengers to David, and said, “I have fought against Rabbah. Yes, I have taken the city of waters."
2 Samuel,12,28,"Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called by my name.”"
2 Samuel,12,29,"David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it."
2 Samuel,12,30,"He took the crown of their king from off his head; and its weight was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David’s head. He brought a great quantity of plunder out of the city."
2 Samuel,12,31,"He brought out the people who were in it, and put them under saws, under iron picks, under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln; and he did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,13,1,"After this, Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her."
2 Samuel,13,2,Amnon was so troubled that he became sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.
2 Samuel,13,3,"But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man."
2 Samuel,13,4,"He said to him, “Why, son of the king, are you so sad from day to day? Won’t you tell me?” Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”"
2 Samuel,13,5,"Jonadab said to him, “Lay down on your bed, and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, tell him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.’”"
2 Samuel,13,6,"So Amnon lay down and faked being sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.”"
2 Samuel,13,7,"Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Go now to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.”"
2 Samuel,13,8,"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was lying down. She took dough, and kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes."
2 Samuel,13,9,"She took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, “Have all men leave me.” Then every man went out from him."
2 Samuel,13,10,"Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the room, that I may eat from your hand.” Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother."
2 Samuel,13,11,"When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister!”"
2 Samuel,13,12,"She answered him, “No, my brother, do not force me! For no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Don’t you do this folly."
2 Samuel,13,13,"As for me, where would I carry my shame? And as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.”"
2 Samuel,13,14,"However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her."
2 Samuel,13,15,"Then Amnon hated her with exceedingly great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, “Arise, be gone!”"
2 Samuel,13,16,"She said to him, “Not so, because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me!” But he would not listen to her."
2 Samuel,13,17,"Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, “Now put this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.”"
2 Samuel,13,18,She had a garment of various colors on her; for the king’s daughters who were virgins dressed in such robes. Then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her.
2 Samuel,13,19,"Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went."
2 Samuel,13,20,"Absalom her brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother. Don’t take this thing to heart.” So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house."
2 Samuel,13,21,"But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry."
2 Samuel,13,22,"Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar."
2 Samuel,13,23,"After two full years, Absalom had sheep shearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons."
2 Samuel,13,24,"Absalom came to the king, and said, “See now, your servant has sheep shearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.”"
2 Samuel,13,25,"The king said to Absalom, “No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.” He pressed him; however he would not go, but blessed him."
2 Samuel,13,26,"Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.” The king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”"
2 Samuel,13,27,"But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him."
2 Samuel,13,28,"Absalom commanded his servants, saying, “Mark now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then kill him. Don’t be afraid. Haven’t I commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant!”"
2 Samuel,13,29,"The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man got up on his mule, and fled."
2 Samuel,13,30,"While they were on the way, the news came to David, saying, “Absalom has slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left!”"
2 Samuel,13,31,"Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn."
2 Samuel,13,32,"Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered, “Don’t let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar."
2 Samuel,13,33,"Now therefore don’t let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead; for only Amnon is dead.”"
2 Samuel,13,34,"But Absalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him."
2 Samuel,13,35,"Jonadab said to the king, “Behold, the king’s sons are coming! It is as your servant said.”"
2 Samuel,13,36,"As soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept. The king also and all his servants wept bitterly."
2 Samuel,13,37,"But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son every day."
2 Samuel,13,38,"So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years."
2 Samuel,13,39,"King David longed to go out to Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead."
2 Samuel,14,1,Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.
2 Samuel,14,2,"Joab sent to Tekoa, and brought a wise woman from there, and said to her, “Please act like a mourner, and put on mourning clothing, please, and don’t anoint yourself with oil, but be as a woman who has mourned a long time for the dead."
2 Samuel,14,3,"Go in to the king, and speak like this to him.” So Joab put the words in her mouth."
2 Samuel,14,4,"When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, showed respect, and said, “Help, O king!”"
2 Samuel,14,5,"The king said to her, “What ails you?” She answered, “Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead."
2 Samuel,14,6,"Your servant had two sons, and they both fought together in the field, and there was no one to part them, but the one struck the other, and killed him."
2 Samuel,14,7,"Behold, the whole family has risen against your servant, and they say, ‘Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed, and so destroy the heir also.’ Thus they would quench my coal which is left, and would leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the surface of the earth.”"
2 Samuel,14,8,"The king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I will give a command concerning you.”"
2 Samuel,14,9,"The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord, O king, may the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house; and may the king and his throne be guiltless.”"
2 Samuel,14,10,"The king said, “Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he will not bother you any more.”"
2 Samuel,14,11,"Then she said, “Please let the king remember Yahweh your God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son.” He said, “As Yahweh lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the earth.”"
2 Samuel,14,12,"Then the woman said, “Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.” He said, “Say on.”"
2 Samuel,14,13,"The woman said, “Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring home again his banished one."
2 Samuel,14,14,"For we must die, and are like water spilled on the ground, which can’t be gathered up again; neither does God take away life, but devises means, that he who is banished not be an outcast from him."
2 Samuel,14,15,"Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid. Your servant said, ‘I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.’"
2 Samuel,14,16,"For the king will hear, to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God."
2 Samuel,14,17,"Then your servant said, ‘Please let the word of my lord the king bring rest; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad. May Yahweh, your God, be with you.’”"
2 Samuel,14,18,"Then the king answered the woman, “Please don’t hide anything from me that I ask you.” The woman said, “Let my lord the king now speak.”"
2 Samuel,14,19,"The king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?” The woman answered, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant Joab urged me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your servant;"
2 Samuel,14,20,"to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing. My lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.”"
2 Samuel,14,21,"The king said to Joab, “Behold now, I have done this thing. Go therefore, and bring the young man Absalom back.”"
2 Samuel,14,22,"Joab fell to the ground on his face, showed respect, and blessed the king. Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant.”"
2 Samuel,14,23,"So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,14,24,"The king said, “Let him return to his own house, but let him not see my face.” So Absalom returned to his own house, and didn’t see the king’s face."
2 Samuel,14,25,Now in all Israel there was no one to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty. From the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no defect in him.
2 Samuel,14,26,"When he cut the hair of his head (now it was at every year’s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels, after the king’s weight."
2 Samuel,14,27,"Three sons were born to Absalom, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar. She was a woman with a beautiful face."
2 Samuel,14,28,"Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, and he didn’t see the king’s face."
2 Samuel,14,29,"Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. Then he sent again a second time, but he would not come."
2 Samuel,14,30,"Therefore he said to his servants, “Behold, Joab’s field is near mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire."
2 Samuel,14,31,"Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said to him, “Why have your servants set my field on fire?”"
2 Samuel,14,32,"Absalom answered Joab, “Behold, I sent to you, saying, ‘Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king’s face, and if there is iniquity in me, let him kill me.”’”"
2 Samuel,14,33,"So Joab came to the king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom."
2 Samuel,15,1,"After this, Absalom prepared a chariot and horses for himself, and fifty men to run before him."
2 Samuel,15,2,"Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate. When any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, “What city are you from?” He said, “Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.”"
2 Samuel,15,3,"Absalom said to him, “Behold, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputized by the king to hear you.”"
2 Samuel,15,4,"Absalom said moreover, “Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!”"
2 Samuel,15,5,"It was so, that when any man came near to bow down to him, he stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him."
2 Samuel,15,6,Absalom did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
2 Samuel,15,7,"At the end of forty years, Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to Yahweh, in Hebron."
2 Samuel,15,8,"For your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Syria, saying, ‘If Yahweh shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Yahweh.’”"
2 Samuel,15,9,"The king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he arose, and went to Hebron."
2 Samuel,15,10,"But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron!’”"
2 Samuel,15,11,"Two hundred men went with Absalom out of Jerusalem, who were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they didn’t know anything."
2 Samuel,15,12,"Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. The conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom."
2 Samuel,15,13,"A messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.”"
2 Samuel,15,14,"David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, “Arise, and let us flee; or else none of us will escape from Absalom. Hurry to depart, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.”"
2 Samuel,15,15,"The king’s servants said to the king, “Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses.”"
2 Samuel,15,16,"The king went out, and all his household after him. The king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house."
2 Samuel,15,17,"The king went out, and all the people after him; and they stayed in Beth Merhak."
2 Samuel,15,18,"All his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king."
2 Samuel,15,19,"Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why do you also go with us? Return, and stay with the king; for you are a foreigner, and also an exile. Return to your own place."
2 Samuel,15,20,"Whereas you came but yesterday, should I today make you go up and down with us, since I go where I may? Return, and take back your brothers. Mercy and truth be with you.”"
2 Samuel,15,21,"Ittai answered the king, and said, “As Yahweh lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king is, whether for death or for life, your servant will be there also.”"
2 Samuel,15,22,"David said to Ittai, “Go and pass over.” Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones who were with him."
2 Samuel,15,23,"All the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over. The king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness."
2 Samuel,15,24,"Behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down God’s ark; and Abiathar went up, until all the people finished passing out of the city."
2 Samuel,15,25,"The king said to Zadok, “Carry God’s ark back into the city. If I find favor in Yahweh’s eyes, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation;"
2 Samuel,15,26,"but if he says, ‘I have no delight in you;’ behold, here am I. Let him do to me as seems good to him.”"
2 Samuel,15,27,"The king said also to Zadok the priest, “Aren’t you a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar."
2 Samuel,15,28,"Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me.”"
2 Samuel,15,29,Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried God’s ark to Jerusalem again; and they stayed there.
2 Samuel,15,30,"David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people who were with him each covered his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up."
2 Samuel,15,31,"Someone told David, saying, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” David said, “Yahweh, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.”"
2 Samuel,15,32,"When David had come to the top, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn, and earth on his head."
2 Samuel,15,33,"David said to him, “If you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me;"
2 Samuel,15,34,"but if you return to the city, and tell Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king. As I have been your father’s servant in time past, so will I now be your servant; then will you defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.’"
2 Samuel,15,35,"Don’t you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you? Therefore whatever you hear out of the king’s house, tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests."
2 Samuel,15,36,"Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son. Send to me everything that you shall hear by them.”"
2 Samuel,15,37,"So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,16,1,"When David was a little past the top, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits, and a bottle of wine."
2 Samuel,16,2,"The king said to Ziba, “What do you mean by these?” Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that those who are faint in the wilderness may drink.”"
2 Samuel,16,3,"The king said, “Where is your master’s son?” Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem; for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will restore me the kingdom of my father.’”"
2 Samuel,16,4,"Then the king said to Ziba, “Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours.” Ziba said, “I bow down. Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king.”"
2 Samuel,16,5,"When king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of Saul’s house came out, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out and cursed as he came."
2 Samuel,16,6,"He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left."
2 Samuel,16,7,"Shimei said when he cursed, “Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, and wicked fellow!"
2 Samuel,16,8,"Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of Saul’s house, in whose place you have reigned! Yahweh has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son! Behold, you are caught by your own mischief, because you are a man of blood!”"
2 Samuel,16,9,"Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head.”"
2 Samuel,16,10,"The king said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because Yahweh has said to him, ‘Curse David;’ who then shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’”"
2 Samuel,16,11,"David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, “Behold, my son, who came out of my bowels, seeks my life. How much more this Benjamite, now? Leave him alone, and let him curse; for Yahweh has invited him."
2 Samuel,16,12,"It may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me, and that Yahweh will repay me good for the cursing of me today.”"
2 Samuel,16,13,"So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him, and cursed as he went, threw stones at him, and threw dust."
2 Samuel,16,14,"The king, and all the people who were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there."
2 Samuel,16,15,"Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him."
2 Samuel,16,16,"When Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, had come to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”"
2 Samuel,16,17,"Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your kindness to your friend? Why didn’t you go with your friend?”"
2 Samuel,16,18,"Hushai said to Absalom, “No; but whomever Yahweh, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him I will stay."
2 Samuel,16,19,"Again, whom should I serve? Shouldn’t I serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father’s presence, so will I be in your presence.”"
2 Samuel,16,20,"Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your counsel what we shall do.”"
2 Samuel,16,21,"Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines that he has left to keep the house. Then all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.”"
2 Samuel,16,22,"So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel."
2 Samuel,16,23,"The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the inner sanctuary of God. So was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom."
2 Samuel,17,1,"Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me now choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David tonight."
2 Samuel,17,2,"I will come on him while he is weary and exhausted, and will make him afraid. All the people who are with him will flee. I will strike the king only,"
2 Samuel,17,3,and I will bring back all the people to you. The man whom you seek is as if all returned. All the people shall be in peace.”
2 Samuel,17,4,"The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel."
2 Samuel,17,5,"Then Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says.”"
2 Samuel,17,6,"When Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, “Ahithophel has spoken like this. Shall we do what he says? If not, speak up.”"
2 Samuel,17,7,"Hushai said to Absalom, “The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.”"
2 Samuel,17,8,"Hushai said moreover, “You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are fierce in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people."
2 Samuel,17,9,"Behold, he is now hidden in some pit, or in some other place. It will happen, when some of them have fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, ‘There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom!’"
2 Samuel,17,10,"Even he who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men."
2 Samuel,17,11,"But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person."
2 Samuel,17,12,"So shall we come on him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light on him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him we will not leave so much as one."
2 Samuel,17,13,"Moreover, if he has gone into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there isn’t one small stone found there.”"
2 Samuel,17,14,"Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.” For Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom."
2 Samuel,17,15,"Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel that way; and I have counseled this way."
2 Samuel,17,16,"Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, ‘Don’t lodge tonight at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.’”"
2 Samuel,17,17,Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a female servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David. For they might not be seen to come into the city.
2 Samuel,17,18,"But a boy saw them, and told Absalom. Then they both went away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there."
2 Samuel,17,19,"The woman took and spread the covering over the well’s mouth, and spread out bruised grain on it; and nothing was known."
2 Samuel,17,20,"Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” The woman said to them, “They have gone over the brook of water.” When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,17,21,"After they had departed, they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said to David, “Arise and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.”"
2 Samuel,17,22,"Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan. By the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan."
2 Samuel,17,23,"When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, arose, and went home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father."
2 Samuel,17,24,"Then David came to Mahanaim. Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him."
2 Samuel,17,25,"Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab’s mother."
2 Samuel,17,26,Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
2 Samuel,17,27,"When David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,"
2 Samuel,17,28,"brought beds, basins, earthen vessels, wheat, barley, meal, parched grain, beans, lentils, roasted grain,"
2 Samuel,17,29,"honey, butter, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat; for they said, “The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty in the wilderness.”"
2 Samuel,18,1,"David counted the people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them."
2 Samuel,18,2,"David sent the people out, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the people, “I will also surely go out with you myself.”"
2 Samuel,18,3,"But the people said, “You shall not go out; for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the city.”"
2 Samuel,18,4,"The king said to them, “I will do what seems best to you.” The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands."
2 Samuel,18,5,"The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, “Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.” All the people heard when the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom."
2 Samuel,18,6,So the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.
2 Samuel,18,7,"The people of Israel were struck there before David’s servants, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men."
2 Samuel,18,8,"For the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured."
2 Samuel,18,9,"Absalom happened to meet David’s servants. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under him went on."
2 Samuel,18,10,"A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, “Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.”"
2 Samuel,18,11,"Joab said to the man who told him, “Behold, you saw it, and why didn’t you strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten pieces of silver, and a sash.”"
2 Samuel,18,12,"The man said to Joab, “Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I still wouldn’t stretch out my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ‘Beware that no one touch the young man Absalom.’"
2 Samuel,18,13,"Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against his life (and there is no matter hidden from the king), then you yourself would have set yourself against me.”"
2 Samuel,18,14,"Then Joab said, “I’m not going to wait like this with you.” He took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the middle of the oak."
2 Samuel,18,15,"Ten young men who bore Joab’s armor surrounded and struck Absalom, and killed him."
2 Samuel,18,16,"Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held the people back."
2 Samuel,18,17,"They took Absalom and cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones. Then all Israel fled, each to his own tent."
2 Samuel,18,18,"Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself the pillar which is in the king’s valley, for he said, “I have no son to keep my name in memory.” He called the pillar after his own name. It is called Absalom’s monument, to this day."
2 Samuel,18,19,"Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, “Let me now run, and carry the king news, how Yahweh has avenged him of his enemies.”"
2 Samuel,18,20,"Joab said to him, “You must not be the bearer of news today, but you must carry news another day. But today you must carry no news, because the king’s son is dead.”"
2 Samuel,18,21,"Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen!” The Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran."
2 Samuel,18,22,"Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, “But come what may, please let me also run after the Cushite.” Joab said, “Why do you want to run, my son, since that you will have no reward for the news?”"
2 Samuel,18,23,"“But come what may,” he said, “I will run.” He said to him, “Run!” Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite."
2 Samuel,18,24,"Now David was sitting between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running alone."
2 Samuel,18,25,"The watchman cried, and told the king. The king said, “If he is alone, there is news in his mouth.” He came closer and closer."
2 Samuel,18,26,"The watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the gatekeeper, and said, “Behold, a man running alone!” The king said, “He also brings news.”"
2 Samuel,18,27,"The watchman said, “I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.” The king said, “He is a good man, and comes with good news.”"
2 Samuel,18,28,"Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, “All is well.” He bowed himself before the king with his face to the earth, and said, “Blessed is Yahweh your God, who has delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king!”"
2 Samuel,18,29,"The king said, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant, even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I don’t know what it was.”"
2 Samuel,18,30,"The king said, “Come and stand here.” He came, and stood still."
2 Samuel,18,31,"Behold, the Cushite came. The Cushite said, “News for my lord the king, for Yahweh has avenged you today of all those who rose up against you.”"
2 Samuel,18,32,"The king said to the Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” The Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you to do you harm, be as that young man is.”"
2 Samuel,18,33,"The king was much moved, and went up to the room over the gate, and wept. As he went, he said, “My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! I wish I had died for you, Absalom, my son, my son!”"
2 Samuel,19,1,"Joab was told, “Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.”"
2 Samuel,19,2,"The victory that day was turned into mourning among all the people; for the people heard it said that day, “The king grieves for his son.”"
2 Samuel,19,3,"The people sneaked into the city that day, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle."
2 Samuel,19,4,"The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, “My son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!”"
2 Samuel,19,5,"Joab came into the house to the king, and said, “Today you have shamed the faces of all your servants, who today have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;"
2 Samuel,19,6,"in that you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you. For you have declared today, that princes and servants are nothing to you. For today I perceive that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died today, then it would have pleased you well."
2 Samuel,19,7,"Now therefore arise, go out, and speak to comfort your servants; for I swear by Yahweh, if you don’t go out, not a man will stay with you this night. That would be worse to you than all the evil that has happened to you from your youth until now.”"
2 Samuel,19,8,"Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. They told to all the people, saying, “Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.” All the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent."
2 Samuel,19,9,"All the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land from Absalom."
2 Samuel,19,10,"Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why don’t you speak a word of bringing the king back?”"
2 Samuel,19,11,"King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? Since the speech of all Israel has come to the king, to return him to his house."
2 Samuel,19,12,You are my brothers. You are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?’
2 Samuel,19,13,"Say to Amasa, ‘Aren’t you my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you aren’t captain of the army before me continually instead of Joab.’”"
2 Samuel,19,14,"He bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as one man; so that they sent to the king, saying, “Return, you and all your servants.”"
2 Samuel,19,15,"So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan."
2 Samuel,19,16,"Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David."
2 Samuel,19,17,"There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of Saul’s house, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king."
2 Samuel,19,18,"A ferry boat went to bring over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he had come over the Jordan."
2 Samuel,19,19,"He said to the king, “Don’t let my lord impute iniquity to me, or remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart."
2 Samuel,19,20,"For your servant knows that I have sinned. Therefore behold, I have come today as the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.”"
2 Samuel,19,21,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, “Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Yahweh’s anointed?”"
2 Samuel,19,22,"David said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should be adversaries to me today? Shall any man be put to death today in Israel? For don’t I know that I am king over Israel today?”"
2 Samuel,19,23,"The king said to Shimei, “You will not die.” The king swore to him."
2 Samuel,19,24,"Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither groomed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace."
2 Samuel,19,25,"When he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, “Why didn’t you go with me, Mephibosheth?”"
2 Samuel,19,26,"He answered, “My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. For your servant said, I will saddle me a donkey, that I may ride on it, and go with the king; because your servant is lame."
2 Samuel,19,27,"He has slandered your servant to my lord the king, but my lord the king is as an angel of God. Do therefore what is good in your eyes."
2 Samuel,19,28,For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more to the king?”
2 Samuel,19,29,"The king said to him, “Why do you speak any more of your matters? I say, you and Ziba divide the land.”"
2 Samuel,19,30,"Mephibosheth said to the king, “Yes, let him take all, because my lord the king has come in peace to his own house.”"
2 Samuel,19,31,"Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan."
2 Samuel,19,32,"Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old. He had provided the king with sustenance while he stayed at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man."
2 Samuel,19,33,"The king said to Barzillai, “Come over with me, and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.”"
2 Samuel,19,34,"Barzillai said to the king, “How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?"
2 Samuel,19,35,"I am eighty years old, today. Can I discern between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear the voice of singing men and singing women any more? Why then should your servant be a burden to my lord the king?"
2 Samuel,19,36,Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward?
2 Samuel,19,37,"Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.”"
2 Samuel,19,38,"The king answered, “Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you. Whatever you request of me, that I will do for you.”"
2 Samuel,19,39,"All the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over. Then the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place."
2 Samuel,19,40,"So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him. All the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel."
2 Samuel,19,41,"Behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, “Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David’s men with him?”"
2 Samuel,19,42,"All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is a close relative to us. Why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king’s cost? Or has he given us any gift?”"
2 Samuel,19,43,"The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, “We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more claim to David than you. Why then did you despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?” The words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel."
2 Samuel,20,1,"There happened to be there a wicked fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite; and he blew the trumpet, and said, “We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to his tents, Israel!”"
2 Samuel,20,2,"So all the men of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah joined with their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem."
2 Samuel,20,3,"David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in custody, and provided them with sustenance, but didn’t go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood."
2 Samuel,20,4,"Then the king said to Amasa, “Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be here present.”"
2 Samuel,20,5,So Amasa went to call the men of Judah together; but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
2 Samuel,20,6,"David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get himself fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.”"
2 Samuel,20,7,"Joab’s men went out after him, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri."
2 Samuel,20,8,"When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was clothed in his apparel of war that he had put on, and on it was a sash with a sword fastened on his waist in its sheath; and as he went along it fell out."
2 Samuel,20,9,"Joab said to Amasa, “Is it well with you, my brother?” Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him."
2 Samuel,20,10,"But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand. So he struck him with it in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and didn’t strike him again; and he died. Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri."
2 Samuel,20,11,"One of Joab’s young men stood by him, and said, “He who favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab!”"
2 Samuel,20,12,"Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the highway. When the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still."
2 Samuel,20,13,"When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri."
2 Samuel,20,14,"He went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth Maacah, and all the Berites. They were gathered together, and went also after him."
2 Samuel,20,15,"They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down."
2 Samuel,20,16,"Then a wise woman cried out of the city, “Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, ‘Come near here, that I may speak with you.’”"
2 Samuel,20,17,"He came near to her; and the woman said, “Are you Joab?” He answered, “I am.” Then she said to him, “Hear the words of your servant.” He answered, “I’m listening.”"
2 Samuel,20,18,"Then she spoke, saying, “They used to say in old times, ‘They shall surely ask counsel at Abel;’ and so they settled a matter."
2 Samuel,20,19,I am among those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why will you swallow up Yahweh’s inheritance?”
2 Samuel,20,20,"Joab answered, “Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy."
2 Samuel,20,21,"The matter is not so. But a man of the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David. Just deliver him, and I will depart from the city.” The woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head will be thrown to you over the wall.”"
2 Samuel,20,22,"Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. He blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king."
2 Samuel,20,23,"Now Joab was over all the army of Israel, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites,"
2 Samuel,20,24,"Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor, Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder,"
2 Samuel,20,25,"Sheva was scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were priests,"
2 Samuel,20,26,and Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David.
2 Samuel,21,1,"There was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David sought the face of Yahweh. Yahweh said, “It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put the Gibeonites to death.”"
2 Samuel,21,2,"The king called the Gibeonites, and said to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites, and the children of Israel had sworn to them; and Saul sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah);"
2 Samuel,21,3,"and David said to the Gibeonites, “What should I do for you? And with what should I make atonement, that you may bless Yahweh’s inheritance?”"
2 Samuel,21,4,"The Gibeonites said to him, “It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.” He said, “Whatever you say, that I will do for you.”"
2 Samuel,21,5,"They said to the king, “The man who consumed us, and who devised against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,"
2 Samuel,21,6,"let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Yahweh.” The king said, “I will give them.”"
2 Samuel,21,7,"But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Yahweh’s oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul."
2 Samuel,21,8,"But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite."
2 Samuel,21,9,"He delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the mountain before Yahweh, and all seven of them fell together. They were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest."
2 Samuel,21,10,"Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water poured on them from the sky. She allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day, nor the animals of the field by night."
2 Samuel,21,11,"David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done."
2 Samuel,21,12,"So David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines killed Saul in Gilboa;"
2 Samuel,21,13,and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son. They also gathered the bones of those who were hanged.
2 Samuel,21,14,"They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. After that, God answered prayer for the land."
2 Samuel,21,15,"The Philistines had war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. David grew faint;"
2 Samuel,21,16,"and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being armed with a new sword, thought he would kill David."
2 Samuel,21,17,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, “Don’t go out with us to battle any more, so that you don’t quench the lamp of Israel.”"
2 Samuel,21,18,"After this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was of the sons of the giant."
2 Samuel,21,19,"There was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite’s brother, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam."
2 Samuel,21,20,"There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on every hand, and six toes on every foot, twenty four in count; and he also was born to the giant."
2 Samuel,21,21,"When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, killed him."
2 Samuel,21,22,"These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants."
Job,7,1,“Isn’t a man forced to labor on earth? Aren’t his days like the days of a hired hand?
Job,7,2,"As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow, as a hireling who looks for his wages,"
Job,7,3,"so am I made to possess months of misery, wearisome nights are appointed to me."
Job,7,4,"When I lie down, I say, ‘When shall I arise, and the night be gone?’ I toss and turn until the dawning of the day."
Job,7,5,"My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust. My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh."
Job,7,6,"My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope."
Job,7,7,Oh remember that my life is a breath. My eye shall no more see good.
Job,7,8,"The eye of him who sees me shall see me no more. Your eyes shall be on me, but I shall not be."
Job,7,9,"As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes down to Sheol shall come up no more."
Job,7,10,"He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more."
Job,7,11,“Therefore I will not keep silent. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit. I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,7,12,"Am I a sea, or a sea monster, that you put a guard over me?"
Job,7,13,"When I say, ‘My bed shall comfort me. My couch shall ease my complaint;’"
Job,7,14,"then you scare me with dreams, and terrify me through visions:"
Job,7,15,"so that my soul chooses strangling, death rather than my bones."
Job,7,16,"I loathe my life. I don’t want to live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath."
Job,7,17,"What is man, that you should magnify him, that you should set your mind on him,"
Job,7,18,"that you should visit him every morning, and test him every moment?"
Job,7,19,"How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle?"
Job,7,20,"If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men? Why have you set me as a mark for you, so that I am a burden to myself?"
Job,7,21,"Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust. You will seek me diligently, but I shall not be.”"
Job,8,1,"Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,"
Job,8,2,“How long will you speak these things? Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?
Job,8,3,Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?
Job,8,4,"If your children have sinned against him, He has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience."
Job,8,5,"If you want to seek God diligently, make your supplication to the Almighty."
Job,8,6,"If you were pure and upright, surely now he would awaken for you, and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous."
Job,8,7,"Though your beginning was small, yet your latter end would greatly increase."
Job,8,8,“Please inquire of past generations. Find out about the learning of their fathers.
Job,8,9,"(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days on earth are a shadow.)"
Job,8,10,"Shall they not teach you, tell you, and utter words out of their heart?"
Job,8,11,“Can the papyrus grow up without mire? Can the rushes grow without water?
Job,8,12,"While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down, it withers before any other reed."
Job,8,13,"So are the paths of all who forget God. The hope of the godless man shall perish,"
Job,8,14,"Whose confidence shall break apart, Whose trust is a spider’s web."
Job,8,15,"He shall lean on his house, but it shall not stand. He shall cling to it, but it shall not endure."
Job,8,16,He is green before the sun. His shoots go out along his garden.
Job,8,17,His roots are wrapped around the rock pile. He sees the place of stones.
Job,8,18,"If he is destroyed from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, ‘I have not seen you.’"
Job,8,19,"Behold, this is the joy of his way: out of the earth, others shall spring."
Job,8,20,"“Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man, neither will he uphold the evildoers."
Job,8,21,"He will still fill your mouth with laughter, your lips with shouting."
Job,8,22,Those who hate you shall be clothed with shame. The tent of the wicked shall be no more.”
Job,9,1,"Then Job answered,"
Job,9,2,"“Truly I know that it is so, but how can man be just with God?"
Job,9,3,"If he is pleased to contend with him, he can’t answer him one time in a thousand."
Job,9,4,"God who is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who has hardened himself against him, and prospered?"
Job,9,5,"He removes the mountains, and they don’t know it, when he overturns them in his anger."
Job,9,6,He shakes the earth out of its place. Its pillars tremble.
Job,9,7,"He commands the sun, and it doesn’t rise, and seals up the stars."
Job,9,8,"He alone stretches out the heavens, and treads on the waves of the sea."
Job,9,9,"He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the rooms of the south."
Job,9,10,"He does great things past finding out; yes, marvelous things without number."
Job,9,11,"Behold, he goes by me, and I don’t see him. He passes on also, but I don’t perceive him."
Job,9,12,"Behold, he snatches away. Who can hinder him? Who will ask him, ‘What are you doing?’"
Job,9,13,“God will not withdraw his anger. The helpers of Rahab stoop under him.
Job,9,14,"How much less shall I answer him, And choose my words to argue with him?"
Job,9,15,"Though I were righteous, yet I wouldn’t answer him. I would make supplication to my judge."
Job,9,16,"If I had called, and he had answered me, yet I wouldn’t believe that he listened to my voice."
Job,9,17,"For he breaks me with a storm, and multiplies my wounds without cause."
Job,9,18,"He will not allow me to catch my breath, but fills me with bitterness."
Job,9,19,"If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty! If of justice, ‘Who,’ says he, ‘will summon me?’"
Job,9,20,"Though I am righteous, my own mouth shall condemn me. Though I am blameless, it shall prove me perverse."
Job,9,21,I am blameless. I don’t respect myself. I despise my life.
Job,9,22,“It is all the same. Therefore I say he destroys the blameless and the wicked.
Job,9,23,"If the scourge kills suddenly, he will mock at the trial of the innocent."
Job,9,24,"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If not he, then who is it?"
Job,9,25,"“Now my days are swifter than a runner. They flee away, they see no good."
Job,9,26,"They have passed away as the swift ships, as the eagle that swoops on the prey."
Job,9,27,"If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face, and cheer up;’"
Job,9,28,"I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that you will not hold me innocent."
Job,9,29,I shall be condemned. Why then do I labor in vain?
Job,9,30,"If I wash myself with snow, and cleanse my hands with lye,"
Job,9,31,yet you will plunge me in the ditch. My own clothes shall abhor me.
Job,9,32,"For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, that we should come together in judgment."
Job,9,33,"There is no umpire between us, that might lay his hand on us both."
Job,9,34,Let him take his rod away from me. Let his terror not make me afraid;
Job,9,35,"then I would speak, and not fear him, for I am not so in myself."
Job,10,1,“My soul is weary of my life. I will give free course to my complaint. I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
Job,10,2,"I will tell God, ‘Do not condemn me. Show me why you contend with me."
Job,10,3,"Is it good to you that you should oppress, that you should despise the work of your hands, and smile on the counsel of the wicked?"
Job,10,4,Do you have eyes of flesh? Or do you see as man sees?
Job,10,5,"Are your days as the days of mortals, or your years as man’s years,"
Job,10,6,"that you inquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin?"
Job,10,7,"Although you know that I am not wicked, there is no one who can deliver out of your hand."
Job,10,8,"“‘Your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether, yet you destroy me."
Job,10,9,"Remember, I beg you, that you have fashioned me as clay. Will you bring me into dust again?"
Job,10,10,"Haven’t you poured me out like milk, and curdled me like cheese?"
Job,10,11,"You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews."
Job,10,12,You have granted me life and loving kindness. Your visitation has preserved my spirit.
Job,10,13,Yet you hid these things in your heart. I know that this is with you:
Job,10,14,"if I sin, then you mark me. You will not acquit me from my iniquity."
Job,10,15,"If I am wicked, woe to me. If I am righteous, I still shall not lift up my head, being filled with disgrace, and conscious of my affliction."
Job,10,16,"If my head is held high, you hunt me like a lion. Again you show yourself powerful to me."
Job,10,17,"You renew your witnesses against me, and increase your indignation on me. Changes and warfare are with me."
Job,10,18,"“‘Why, then, have you brought me out of the womb? I wish I had given up the spirit, and no eye had seen me."
Job,10,19,I should have been as though I had not been. I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
Job,10,20,"Aren’t my days few? Cease then. Leave me alone, that I may find a little comfort,"
Job,10,21,"before I go where I shall not return from, to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;"
Job,10,22,"the land dark as midnight, of the shadow of death, without any order, where the light is as midnight.’”"
Job,11,1,"Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered,"
Job,11,2,“Shouldn’t the multitude of words be answered? Should a man full of talk be justified?
Job,11,3,"Should your boastings make men hold their peace? When you mock, shall no man make you ashamed?"
Job,11,4,"For you say, ‘My doctrine is pure. I am clean in your eyes.’"
Job,11,5,"But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against you,"
Job,11,6,that he would show you the secrets of wisdom! For true wisdom has two sides. Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves.
Job,11,7,“Can you fathom the mystery of God? Or can you probe the limits of the Almighty?
Job,11,8,They are high as heaven. What can you do? They are deeper than Sheol. What can you know?
Job,11,9,"Its measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea."
Job,11,10,"If he passes by, or confines, or convenes a court, then who can oppose him?"
Job,11,11,"For he knows false men. He sees iniquity also, even though he doesn’t consider it."
Job,11,12,An empty-headed man becomes wise when a man is born as a wild donkey’s colt.
Job,11,13,"“If you set your heart aright, stretch out your hands toward him."
Job,11,14,"If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away. Don’t let unrighteousness dwell in your tents."
Job,11,15,"Surely then you shall lift up your face without spot; Yes, you shall be steadfast, and shall not fear:"
Job,11,16,for you shall forget your misery. You shall remember it like waters that have passed away.
Job,11,17,"Life shall be clearer than the noonday. Though there is darkness, it shall be as the morning."
Job,11,18,"You shall be secure, because there is hope. Yes, you shall search, and shall take your rest in safety."
Job,11,19,"Also you shall lie down, and no one shall make you afraid. Yes, many shall court your favor."
Job,11,20,But the eyes of the wicked shall fail. They shall have no way to flee. Their hope shall be the giving up of the spirit.”
Job,12,1,"Then Job answered,"
Job,12,2,"“No doubt, but you are the people, and wisdom shall die with you."
Job,12,3,"But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Yes, who doesn’t know such things as these?"
Job,12,4,"I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor, I, who called on God, and he answered. The just, the blameless man is a joke."
Job,12,5,In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune. It is ready for them whose foot slips.
Job,12,6,"The tents of robbers prosper. Those who provoke God are secure, who carry their God in their hands."
Job,12,7,"“But ask the animals, now, and they shall teach you; the birds of the sky, and they shall tell you."
Job,12,8,"Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach you. The fish of the sea shall declare to you."
Job,12,9,"Who doesn’t know that in all these, Yahweh’s hand has done this,"
Job,12,10,"in whose hand is the life of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind?"
Job,12,11,"Doesn’t the ear try words, even as the palate tastes its food?"
Job,12,12,"With aged men is wisdom, in length of days understanding."
Job,12,13,“With God is wisdom and might. He has counsel and understanding.
Job,12,14,"Behold, he breaks down, and it can’t be built again. He imprisons a man, and there can be no release."
Job,12,15,"Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up. Again, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth."
Job,12,16,With him is strength and wisdom. The deceived and the deceiver are his.
Job,12,17,He leads counselors away stripped. He makes judges fools.
Job,12,18,He loosens the bond of kings. He binds their waist with a belt.
Job,12,19,"He leads priests away stripped, and overthrows the mighty."
Job,12,20,"He removes the speech of those who are trusted, and takes away the understanding of the elders."
Job,12,21,"He pours contempt on princes, and loosens the belt of the strong."
Job,12,22,"He uncovers deep things out of darkness, and brings out to light the shadow of death."
Job,12,23,"He increases the nations, and he destroys them. He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive."
Job,12,24,"He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way."
Job,12,25,They grope in the dark without light. He makes them stagger like a drunken man.
Job,13,1,"“Behold, my eye has seen all this. My ear has heard and understood it."
Job,13,2,"What you know, I know also. I am not inferior to you."
Job,13,3,“Surely I would speak to the Almighty. I desire to reason with God.
Job,13,4,But you are forgers of lies. You are all physicians of no value.
Job,13,5,Oh that you would be completely silent! Then you would be wise.
Job,13,6,Hear now my reasoning. Listen to the pleadings of my lips.
Job,13,7,"Will you speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him?"
Job,13,8,Will you show partiality to him? Will you contend for God?
Job,13,9,"Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceives a man, will you deceive him?"
Job,13,10,"He will surely reprove you, if you secretly show partiality."
Job,13,11,"Shall not his majesty make you afraid, And his dread fall on you?"
Job,13,12,"Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defenses are defenses of clay."
Job,13,13,"“Be silent, leave me alone, that I may speak. Let come on me what will."
Job,13,14,"Why should I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand?"
Job,13,15,"Behold, he will kill me. I have no hope. Nevertheless, I will maintain my ways before him."
Job,13,16,"This also shall be my salvation, that a godless man shall not come before him."
Job,13,17,Hear diligently my speech. Let my declaration be in your ears.
Job,13,18,"See now, I have set my cause in order. I know that I am righteous."
Job,13,19,Who is he who will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and give up the spirit.
Job,13,20,“Only don’t do two things to me; then I will not hide myself from your face:
Job,13,21,withdraw your hand far from me; and don’t let your terror make me afraid.
Job,13,22,"Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and you answer me."
Job,13,23,How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me know my disobedience and my sin.
Job,13,24,"Why hide you your face, and hold me for your enemy?"
Job,13,25,Will you harass a driven leaf? Will you pursue the dry stubble?
Job,13,26,"For you write bitter things against me, and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth:"
Job,13,27,"You also put my feet in the stocks, and mark all my paths. You set a bound to the soles of my feet,"
Job,13,28,"though I am decaying like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten."
Job,14,1,"“Man, who is born of a woman, is of few days, and full of trouble."
Job,14,2,"He grows up like a flower, and is cut down. He also flees like a shadow, and doesn’t continue."
Job,14,3,"Do you open your eyes on such a one, and bring me into judgment with you?"
Job,14,4,Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.
Job,14,5,"Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is with you, and you have appointed his bounds that he can’t pass;"
Job,14,6,"Look away from him, that he may rest, until he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day."
Job,14,7,"“For there is hope for a tree, If it is cut down, that it will sprout again, that the tender branch of it will not cease."
Job,14,8,"Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stock dies in the ground,"
Job,14,9,"yet through the scent of water it will bud, and sprout boughs like a plant."
Job,14,10,"But man dies, and is laid low. Yes, man gives up the spirit, and where is he?"
Job,14,11,"As the waters fail from the sea, and the river wastes and dries up,"
Job,14,12,"so man lies down and doesn’t rise. Until the heavens are no more, they shall not awake, nor be roused out of their sleep."
Job,14,13,"“Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, that you would keep me secret, until your wrath is past, that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!"
Job,14,14,"If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my warfare would I wait, until my release should come."
Job,14,15,"You would call, and I would answer you. You would have a desire to the work of your hands."
Job,14,16,But now you count my steps. Don’t you watch over my sin?
Job,14,17,My disobedience is sealed up in a bag. You fasten up my iniquity.
Job,14,18,“But the mountain falling comes to nothing. The rock is removed out of its place;
Job,14,19,The waters wear the stones. The torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth. So you destroy the hope of man.
Job,14,20,"You forever prevail against him, and he departs. You change his face, and send him away."
Job,14,21,"His sons come to honor, and he doesn’t know it. They are brought low, but he doesn’t perceive it of them."
Job,14,22,"But his flesh on him has pain, and his soul within him mourns.”"
Job,15,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,"
Job,15,2,"“Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge, and fill himself with the east wind?"
Job,15,3,"Should he reason with unprofitable talk, or with speeches with which he can do no good?"
Job,15,4,"Yes, you do away with fear, and hinder devotion before God."
Job,15,5,"For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the language of the crafty."
Job,15,6,"Your own mouth condemns you, and not I. Yes, your own lips testify against you."
Job,15,7,“Are you the first man who was born? Or were you brought out before the hills?
Job,15,8,Have you heard the secret counsel of God? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?
Job,15,9,"What do you know, that we don’t know? What do you understand, which is not in us?"
Job,15,10,"With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, much elder than your father."
Job,15,11,"Are the consolations of God too small for you, even the word that is gentle toward you?"
Job,15,12,"Why does your heart carry you away? Why do your eyes flash,"
Job,15,13,"That you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go out of your mouth?"
Job,15,14,"What is man, that he should be clean? What is he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?"
Job,15,15,"Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones. Yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight;"
Job,15,16,"how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks iniquity like water!"
Job,15,17,"“I will show you, listen to me; that which I have seen I will declare"
Job,15,18,"(which wise men have told by their fathers, and have not hidden it;"
Job,15,19,"to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them):"
Job,15,20,"the wicked man writhes in pain all his days, even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor."
Job,15,21,A sound of terrors is in his ears. In prosperity the destroyer shall come on him.
Job,15,22,He doesn’t believe that he shall return out of darkness. He is waited for by the sword.
Job,15,23,"He wanders abroad for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’ He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand."
Job,15,24,"Distress and anguish make him afraid. They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle."
Job,15,25,"Because he has stretched out his hand against God, and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty;"
Job,15,26,"he runs at him with a stiff neck, with the thick shields of his bucklers;"
Job,15,27,"because he has covered his face with his fatness, and gathered fat on his thighs."
Job,15,28,"He has lived in desolate cities, in houses which no one inhabited, which were ready to become heaps."
Job,15,29,"He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth."
Job,15,30,He shall not depart out of darkness. The flame shall dry up his branches. By the breath of God’s mouth shall he go away.
Job,15,31,"Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself; for emptiness shall be his reward."
Job,15,32,It shall be accomplished before his time. His branch shall not be green.
Job,15,33,"He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive tree."
Job,15,34,"For the company of the godless shall be barren, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery."
Job,15,35,"They conceive mischief, and produce iniquity. Their heart prepares deceit.”"
Job,16,1,"Then Job answered,"
Job,16,2,“I have heard many such things. You are all miserable comforters!
Job,16,3,Shall vain words have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer?
Job,16,4,"I also could speak as you do. If your soul were in my soul’s place, I could join words together against you, and shake my head at you,"
Job,16,5,but I would strengthen you with my mouth. The solace of my lips would relieve you.
Job,16,6,"“Though I speak, my grief is not subsided. Though I forbear, what am I eased?"
Job,16,7,"But now, God, you have surely worn me out. You have made desolate all my company."
Job,16,8,You have shriveled me up. This is a witness against me. My leanness rises up against me. It testifies to my face.
Job,16,9,"He has torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me. He has gnashed on me with his teeth. My adversary sharpens his eyes on me."
Job,16,10,They have gaped on me with their mouth. They have struck me on the cheek reproachfully. They gather themselves together against me.
Job,16,11,"God delivers me to the ungodly, and casts me into the hands of the wicked."
Job,16,12,"I was at ease, and he broke me apart. Yes, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces. He has also set me up for his target."
Job,16,13,"His archers surround me. He splits my kidneys apart, and does not spare. He pours out my gall on the ground."
Job,16,14,He breaks me with breach on breach. He runs on me like a giant.
Job,16,15,"I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, and have thrust my horn in the dust."
Job,16,16,My face is red with weeping. Deep darkness is on my eyelids.
Job,16,17,"Although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure."
Job,16,18,"“Earth, don’t cover my blood. Let my cry have no place to rest."
Job,16,19,"Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven. He who vouches for me is on high."
Job,16,20,"My friends scoff at me. My eyes pour out tears to God,"
Job,16,21,"that he would maintain the right of a man with God, of a son of man with his neighbor!"
Job,16,22,"For when a few years have come, I shall go the way of no return."
Job,17,1,"“My spirit is consumed. My days are extinct, And the grave is ready for me."
Job,17,2,Surely there are mockers with me. My eye dwells on their provocation.
Job,17,3,"“Now give a pledge, be collateral for me with yourself. Who is there who will strike hands with me?"
Job,17,4,"For you have hidden their heart from understanding, Therefore you shall not exalt them."
Job,17,5,"He who denounces his friends for plunder, Even the eyes of his children shall fail."
Job,17,6,“But he has made me a byword of the people. They spit in my face.
Job,17,7,My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow. All my members are as a shadow.
Job,17,8,Upright men shall be astonished at this. The innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.
Job,17,9,Yet shall the righteous hold on his way. He who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger.
Job,17,10,"But as for you all, come on now again; I shall not find a wise man among you."
Job,17,11,"My days are past, my plans are broken off, as are the thoughts of my heart."
Job,17,12,"They change the night into day, saying ‘The light is near’ in the presence of darkness."
Job,17,13,"If I look for Sheol as my house, if I have spread my couch in the darkness,"
Job,17,14,"If I have said to corruption, ‘You are my father;’ to the worm, ‘My mother,’ and ‘my sister;’"
Job,17,15,"where then is my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?"
Job,17,16,"Shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol, or descend together into the dust?”"
Job,18,1,"Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,"

Job,20,16,He shall suck cobra venom. The viper’s tongue shall kill him.
Job,20,17,"He shall not look at the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and butter."
Job,20,18,"That for which he labored he shall restore, and shall not swallow it down. According to the substance that he has gotten, he shall not rejoice."
Job,20,19,"For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor. He has violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up."

Job,20,24,He shall flee from the iron weapon. The bronze arrow shall strike him through.
Job,20,25,"He draws it out, and it comes out of his body. Yes, the glittering point comes out of his liver. Terrors are on him."
Job,20,26,All darkness is laid up for his treasures. An unfanned fire shall devour him. It shall consume that which is left in his tent.
Job,20,27,The heavens shall reveal his iniquity. The earth shall rise up against him.
Job,20,28,The increase of his house shall depart. They shall rush away in the day of his wrath.
Job,20,29,"This is the portion of a wicked man from God, the heritage appointed to him by God.”"

Job,21,3,"Allow me, and I also will speak; After I have spoken, mock on."
Job,21,4,"As for me, is my complaint to man? Why shouldn’t I be impatient?"
Job,21,5,"Look at me, and be astonished. Lay your hand on your mouth."
Job,21,6,"When I remember, I am troubled. Horror takes hold of my flesh."

Job,21,12,"They sing to the tambourine and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe."
Job,21,13,They spend their days in prosperity. In an instant they go down to Sheol.
Job,21,14,"They tell God, ‘Depart from us, for we don’t want to know about your ways."
Job,21,15,"What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What profit should we have, if we pray to him?’"
Job,21,16,"Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand. The counsel of the wicked is far from me."
Job,21,17,"“How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out, that their calamity comes on them, that God distributes sorrows in his anger?"
Job,21,18,"How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind, as chaff that the storm carries away?"
Job,21,19,"You say, ‘God lays up his iniquity for his children.’ Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it."
Job,21,20,Let his own eyes see his destruction. Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
Job,21,21,"For what does he care for his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off?"
Job,21,22,"“Shall any teach God knowledge, since he judges those who are high?"
Job,21,23,"One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet."
Job,21,24,His pails are full of milk. The marrow of his bones is moistened.
Job,21,25,"Another dies in bitterness of soul, and never tastes of good."

Job,21,31,Who shall declare his way to his face? Who shall repay him what he has done?
Job,21,32,Yet he will be borne to the grave. Men shall keep watch over the tomb.
Job,21,33,"The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him. All men shall draw after him, as there were innumerable before him."

Jeremiah,36,1,"In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,"
Jeremiah,36,2,"“Take a scroll of a book, and write in it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day."
Jeremiah,36,3,It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I intend to do to them; that they may each return from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.”
Jeremiah,36,4,"Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all Yahweh’s words, which he had spoken to him, on a scroll of a book."
Jeremiah,36,5,"Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, “I am restricted. I can’t go into Yahweh’s house."
Jeremiah,36,6,"Therefore you go, and read from the scroll which you have written from my mouth, Yahweh’s words, in the ears of the people in Yahweh’s house on the fast day. Also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities."
Jeremiah,36,7,"It may be they will present their supplication before Yahweh, and will each return from his evil way; for Yahweh has pronounced great anger and wrath against this people.”"
Jeremiah,36,8,"Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book Yahweh’s words in Yahweh’s house."
Jeremiah,36,9,"Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Yahweh."
Jeremiah,36,10,"Then Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the book in Yahweh’s house, in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh’s house, in the ears of all the people."
Jeremiah,36,11,"When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all Yahweh’s words,"
Jeremiah,36,12,"he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s room: and behold, all the princes were sitting there, Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes."
Jeremiah,36,13,"Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people."
Jeremiah,36,14,"Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the ears of the people, and come.” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand, and came to them."
Jeremiah,36,15,"They said to him, “Sit down now, and read it in our hearing.” So Baruch read it in their hearing."
Jeremiah,36,16,"Now when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, “We will surely tell the king of all these words.”"
Jeremiah,36,17,"They asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us now, how did you write all these words at his mouth?”"
Jeremiah,36,18,"Then Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.”"
Jeremiah,36,19,"Then the princes said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah go hide. Don’t let anyone know where you are.”"
Jeremiah,36,20,They went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe. Then they told all the words in the hearing of the king.
Jeremiah,36,21,"So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll; and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king, and in the hearing of all the princes who stood beside the king."
Jeremiah,36,22,Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month; and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him.
Jeremiah,36,23,"When Jehudi had read three or four leaves, the king cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier."
Jeremiah,36,24,"The king and his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, and didn’t tear their garments."
Jeremiah,36,25,Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll; but he would not listen to them.
Jeremiah,36,26,"The king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Yahweh hid them."
Jeremiah,36,27,"Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, after the king had burned the scroll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,36,28,"“Take again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned."
Jeremiah,36,29,"Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Yahweh says: “You have burned this scroll, saying, “Why have you written therein, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cause to cease from there man and animal?’”’"
Jeremiah,36,30,"Therefore Yahweh says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: “He will have no one to sit on David’s throne. His dead body will be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost."
Jeremiah,36,31,"I will punish him, his offspring, and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring on them, on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they didn’t listen.”’”"
Jeremiah,36,32,"Then took Jeremiah another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them."
Jeremiah,37,1,"Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king, instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah."
Jeremiah,37,2,"But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, listened to Yahweh’s words, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah."
Jeremiah,37,3,"Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “Pray now to Yahweh our God for us.”"
Jeremiah,37,4,Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for they had not put him into prison.
Jeremiah,37,5,"Pharaoh’s army had come out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they broke up from Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,37,6,"Then Yahweh’s word came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,37,7,"“Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘You shall tell the king of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me: “Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which has come out to help you, will return to Egypt into their own land."
Jeremiah,37,8,"The Chaldeans will come again, and fight against this city. They will take it and burn it with fire.”’"
Jeremiah,37,9,"“Yahweh says, ‘Don’t deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely depart from us;” for they will not depart."
Jeremiah,37,10,"For though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yes they would each rise up in his tent and burn this city with fire.’”"
Jeremiah,37,11,"When the army of the Chaldeans had broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,"
Jeremiah,37,12,"then Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the middle of the people."
Jeremiah,37,13,"When he was in Benjamin’s gate, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are defecting to the Chaldeans!”"
Jeremiah,37,14,"Then Jeremiah said, “That is false! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans.” But he didn’t listen to him; so Irijah siezed Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes."
Jeremiah,37,15,"The princes were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison."
Jeremiah,37,16,"When Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days,"
Jeremiah,37,17,"then Zedekiah the king sent, and had him brought out. The king asked him secretly in his house, “Is there any word from Yahweh?” Jeremiah said, “There is.” He also said, “You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.”"
Jeremiah,37,18,"Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you, against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?"
Jeremiah,37,19,"Now where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you, nor against this land?’"
Jeremiah,37,20,"Now please hear, my lord the king: please let my supplication be presented before you, that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.”"
Jeremiah,37,21,"Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard. They gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard."
Jeremiah,38,1,"Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying,"
Jeremiah,38,2,"“Yahweh says, ‘He who remains in this city will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he who goes out to the Chaldeans will live, and he will escape with his life, and he will live.’"
Jeremiah,38,3,"Yahweh says, ‘This city will surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will take it.’”"
Jeremiah,38,4,"Then the princes said to the king, “Please let this man be put to death; because he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man doesn’t seek the welfare of this people, but harm.”"
Jeremiah,38,5,"Zedekiah the king said, “Behold, he is in your hand; for the king can’t do anything to oppose you.”"
Jeremiah,38,6,"Then took they Jeremiah and threw him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king’s son, that was in the court of the guard. They let down Jeremiah with cords. In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire."
Jeremiah,38,7,"Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king was then sitting in Benjamin’s gate),"
Jeremiah,38,8,"Ebedmelech went out of the king’s house, and spoke to the king, saying,"
Jeremiah,38,9,"“My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon. He is likely to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.”"
Jeremiah,38,10,"Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take from here thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dies.”"
Jeremiah,38,11,"So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah."
Jeremiah,38,12,"Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Now put these rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the cords.” Jeremiah did so."
Jeremiah,38,13,"So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard."
Jeremiah,38,14,"Then Zedekiah the king sent and took Jeremiah the prophet to himself into the third entry that is in Yahweh’s house. Then the king said to Jeremiah, “I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me.”"
Jeremiah,38,15,"Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? If I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.”"
Jeremiah,38,16,"So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, “As Yahweh lives, who made us this soul, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.”"
Jeremiah,38,17,"Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you will go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then your soul will live, and this city will not be burned with fire. You will live, along with your house."
Jeremiah,38,18,"But if you will not go out to the king of Babylon’s princes, then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you won’t escape out of their hand.’”"
Jeremiah,38,19,"Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have defected to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.”"
Jeremiah,38,20,"But Jeremiah said, “They won’t deliver you. Obey, I beg you, Yahweh’s voice, in that which I speak to you; so it will be well with you, and your soul will live."
Jeremiah,38,21,"But if you refuse to go out, this is the word that Yahweh has shown me:"
Jeremiah,38,22,"‘Behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah’s house will be brought out to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women will say, “Your familiar friends have turned on you, and have prevailed over you. Your feet are sunk in the mire, they have turned away from you.”"
Jeremiah,38,23,"They will bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans. You won’t escape out of their hand, but will be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. You will cause this city to be burned with fire.’”"
Jeremiah,38,24,"Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no man know of these words, and you won’t die."
Jeremiah,38,25,"But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and tell you, ‘Declare to us now what you have said to the king; don’t hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also tell us what the king said to you;’"
Jeremiah,38,26,"then you shall tell them, ‘I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.’”"
Jeremiah,38,27,"Then all the princes came to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived."
Jeremiah,38,28,So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.
Jeremiah,39,1,"In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem, and besieged it."
Jeremiah,39,2,"In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city."
Jeremiah,39,3,"All the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, Nergal Sharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon."
Jeremiah,39,4,"When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah."
Jeremiah,39,5,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. When they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment on him."
Jeremiah,39,6,Then the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah’s sons in Riblah before his eyes. The king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah.
Jeremiah,39,7,"Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon."
Jeremiah,39,8,"The Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem."
Jeremiah,39,9,"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city, the deserters also who fell away to him, and the residue of the people who remained."
Jeremiah,39,10,"But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time."
Jeremiah,39,11,"Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon commanded Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard concerning Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,39,12,"“Take him, and take care of him. Do him no harm; but do to him even as he tells you.”"
Jeremiah,39,13,"So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, with Nebushazban, Rabsaris, and Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon;"
Jeremiah,39,14,"they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home. So he lived among the people."
Jeremiah,39,15,"Now Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,"
Jeremiah,39,16,"“Go, and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: “Behold, I will bring my words on this city for evil, and not for good; and they will be accomplished before you in that day."
Jeremiah,39,17,"But I will deliver you in that day,” says Yahweh; “and you will not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid."
Jeremiah,39,18,"For I will surely save you, and you won’t fall by the sword, but you will escape with your life; because you have put your trust in me,” says Yahweh.’”"
Jeremiah,40,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away captive to Babylon."
Jeremiah,40,2,"The captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, “Yahweh your God pronounced this evil on this place;"
Jeremiah,40,3,"and Yahweh has brought it, and done according as he spoke. Because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing has come on you."
Jeremiah,40,4,"Now, behold, I release you today from the chains which are on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will take care of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon, don’t. Behold, all the land is before you. Where it seems good and right to you to go, there go.”"
Jeremiah,40,5,"Now while he had not yet gone back, “Go back then,” he said, “to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people; or go wherever it seems right to you to go.” So the captain of the guard gave him food and a present, and let him go."
Jeremiah,40,6,"Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land."
Jeremiah,40,7,"Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, women, children, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon;"
Jeremiah,40,8,"then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men came to Gedaliah to Mizpah."
Jeremiah,40,9,"Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, “Don’t be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you."
Jeremiah,40,10,"As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who will come to us; but you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.”"
Jeremiah,40,11,"Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;"
Jeremiah,40,12,"then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered very much wine and summer fruits."
Jeremiah,40,13,"Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,"
Jeremiah,40,14,"and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn’t believe them."
Jeremiah,40,15,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, “Please let me go, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man will know it. Why should he take your life, that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?”"
Jeremiah,40,16,"But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You shall not do this thing; for you speak falsely of Ishmael.”"
Jeremiah,41,1,"Now in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal offspring and one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah."
Jeremiah,41,2,"Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land."
Jeremiah,41,3,"Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war."
Jeremiah,41,4,"The second day after he had killed Gedaliah, and no man knew it,"
Jeremiah,41,5,"men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to Yahweh’s house."
Jeremiah,41,6,"Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and as he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.”"
Jeremiah,41,7,"It was so, when they came into the middle of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, and cast them into the middle of the pit, he, and the men who were with him."
Jeremiah,41,8,"But ten men were found among those who said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey.” So he stopped, and didn’t kill them among their brothers."
Jeremiah,41,9,"Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had killed, by the side of Gedaliah (the same was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were killed."
Jeremiah,41,10,"Then Ishmael carried away captive all the of the people who were left in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon."
Jeremiah,41,11,"But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,"
Jeremiah,41,12,"then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon."
Jeremiah,41,13,"Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, then they were glad."
Jeremiah,41,14,"So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah."
Jeremiah,41,15,"But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon."
Jeremiah,41,16,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were with him took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the men of war, with the women, the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon."
Jeremiah,41,17,"They departed and lived in Geruth Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt"
Jeremiah,41,18,"because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land."
Jeremiah,42,1,"Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came near,"
Jeremiah,42,2,"and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Please let our supplication be presented before you, and pray for us to Yahweh your God, even for all this remnant; for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes see us;"
Jeremiah,42,3,"that Yahweh your God may show us the way in which we should walk, and the things that we should do.”"
Jeremiah,42,4,"Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to Yahweh your God according to your words; and it will happen that whatever thing Yahweh answers you, I will declare it to you. I will keep nothing back from you.”"
Jeremiah,42,5,"Then they said to Jeremiah, “May Yahweh be a true and faithful witness among us, if we don’t do according to all the word with which Yahweh your God sends you to tell us."
Jeremiah,42,6,"Whether it is good, or whether it is bad, we will obey the voice of Yahweh our God, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of Yahweh our God.”"
Jeremiah,42,7,"After ten days, Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah."
Jeremiah,42,8,"Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,"
Jeremiah,42,9,"and said to them, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him, says:"
Jeremiah,42,10,"‘If you will still live in this land, then I will build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you."
Jeremiah,42,11,"Don’t be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid. Don’t be afraid of him,’ says Yahweh: ‘for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand."
Jeremiah,42,12,"I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you, and cause you to return to your own land."
Jeremiah,42,13,"“‘But if you say, “We will not dwell in this land;” so that you don’t obey Yahweh your God’s voice,"
Jeremiah,42,14,"saying, “No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we will see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:”’"
Jeremiah,42,15,"now therefore hear Yahweh’s word, O remnant of Judah: Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, ‘If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to live there;"
Jeremiah,42,16,"then it will happen that the sword, which you fear, will overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are afraid, will follow close behind you there in Egypt; and you will die there."
Jeremiah,42,17,"So will it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there. They will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. None of them will remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.’"
Jeremiah,42,18,"For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘As my anger and my wrath has been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you, when you enter into Egypt; and you will be an object of horror, an astonishment, a curse, and a reproach; and you will see this place no more.’"
Jeremiah,42,19,"“Yahweh has spoken concerning you, remnant of Judah, ‘Don’t go into Egypt!’ Know certainly that I have testified to you today."
Jeremiah,42,20,"For you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for you sent me to Yahweh your God, saying, ‘Pray for us to Yahweh our God; and according to all that Yahweh our God says, so declare to us, and we will do it.’"
Jeremiah,42,21,I have declared it to you today; but you have not obeyed Yahweh your God’s voice in anything for which he has sent me to you.
Jeremiah,42,22,"Now therefore know certainly that you will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live there.”"
Jeremiah,43,1,"When Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God, with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them, even all these words,"
Jeremiah,43,2,"then Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, “You speak falsely. Yahweh our God has not sent you to say, ‘You shall not go into Egypt to live there;’"
Jeremiah,43,3,"but Baruch the son of Neriah has turned you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.”"
Jeremiah,43,4,"So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice, to dwell in the land of Judah."
Jeremiah,43,5,"But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, who had returned from all the nations where they had been driven, to live in the land of Judah;"
Jeremiah,43,6,"the men, and the women, and the children, and the king’s daughters, and every person who Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah;"
Jeremiah,43,7,and they came into the land of Egypt; for they didn’t obey Yahweh’s voice: and they came to Tahpanhes.
Jeremiah,43,8,"Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,"
Jeremiah,43,9,"“Take great stones in your hand, and hide them in mortar in the brick work, which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;"
Jeremiah,43,10,"and tell them, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne on these stones that I have hidden; and he will spread his royal pavilion over them."
Jeremiah,43,11,"He will come, and will strike the land of Egypt; such as are for death will be put to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword."
Jeremiah,43,12,"I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt. He will burn them, and carry them away captive. He will array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he will go out from there in peace."
Jeremiah,43,13,"He will also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and he will burn the houses of the gods of Egypt with fire.’”"

Jeremiah,44,3,"because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, to serve other gods that they didn’t know, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers."
Jeremiah,44,4,"However I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, “Oh, don’t do this abominable thing that I hate.”"
Jeremiah,44,5,"But they didn’t listen and didn’t incline their ear. They didn’t turn from their wickedness, to stop burning incense to other gods."
Jeremiah,44,6,"Therefore my wrath and my anger was poured out, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is today.’"
Jeremiah,44,7,"“Therefore now Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Why do you commit great evil against your own souls, to cut off from yourselves man and woman, infant and nursing child out of the middle of Judah, to leave yourselves no one remaining;"
Jeremiah,44,8,"in that you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you have gone to live; that you may be cut off, and that you may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?"
Jeremiah,44,9,"Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?"
Jeremiah,44,10,"They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.’"
Jeremiah,44,11,"“Therefore Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah."
Jeremiah,44,12,"I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to live there, and they will all be consumed. They will fall in the land of Egypt. They will be consumed by the sword and by the famine. They will die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine. They will be an object of horror, an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach."
Jeremiah,44,13,"For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;"
Jeremiah,44,14,"so that none of the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there, will escape or be left to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there; for no one will return except those who will escape.’”"
Jeremiah,44,15,"Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, even all the people who lived in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,"
Jeremiah,44,16,"“As for the word that you have spoken to us in Yahweh’s name, we will not listen to you."

Jeremiah,44,18,"But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of the sky, and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine."
Jeremiah,44,19,"“When we burned incense to the queen of the sky, and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her, without our husbands?”"
Jeremiah,44,20,"Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men, and to the women, even to all the people who had given him an answer, saying,"
Jeremiah,44,21,"“The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, didn’t Yahweh remember them, and didn’t it come into his mind?"
Jeremiah,44,22,"Thus Yahweh could no longer bear it, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which you have committed. Therefore your land has become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is today."
Jeremiah,44,23,"Because you have burned incense, and because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed Yahweh’s voice, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil has happened to you, as it is today.”"

Matthew,21,33,"“Hear another parable. There was a man who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a wine press in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another country."
Matthew,21,34,"When the season for the fruit came near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruit."
Matthew,21,35,"The farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another."
Matthew,21,36,"Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they treated them the same way."
Matthew,21,37,"But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’"
Matthew,21,38,"But the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and seize his inheritance.’"
Matthew,21,39,"So they took him, and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him."
Matthew,21,40,"When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?”"
Matthew,21,41,"They told him, “He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give him the fruit in its season.”"
Matthew,21,42,"Jesus said to them, “Did you never read in the Scriptures, ‘The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner. This was from the Lord. It is marvelous in our eyes?’"
Matthew,21,43,"“Therefore I tell you, God’s Kingdom will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation producing its fruit."
Matthew,21,44,"He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on whomever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust.”"
Matthew,21,45,"When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke about them."
Matthew,21,46,"When they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they considered him to be a prophet."
Matthew,22,1,"Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, saying,"
Matthew,22,2,"“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,"
Matthew,22,3,"and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast, but they would not come."
Matthew,22,4,"Again he sent out other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My cattle and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast!”’"
Matthew,22,5,"But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise,"
Matthew,22,6,"and the rest grabbed his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them."
Matthew,22,7,"When the king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city."
Matthew,22,8,"“Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren’t worthy."
Matthew,22,9,"Go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the marriage feast.’"
Matthew,22,10,"Those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests."
Matthew,22,11,"But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didn’t have on wedding clothing,"
Matthew,22,12,"and he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?’ He was speechless."
Matthew,22,13,"Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness. That is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.’"
Matthew,22,14,"For many are called, but few chosen.”"
Matthew,22,15,Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk.
Matthew,22,16,"They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter whom you teach, for you aren’t partial to anyone."
Matthew,22,17,"Tell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”"
Matthew,22,18,"But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, “Why do you test me, you hypocrites?"
Matthew,22,19,Show me the tax money.” They brought to him a denarius.
Matthew,22,20,"He asked them, “Whose is this image and inscription?”"
Matthew,22,21,"They said to him, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”"
Matthew,22,22,"When they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went away."
Matthew,22,23,"On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him,"
Matthew,22,24,"saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up offspring for his brother.’"
Matthew,22,25,"Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother."
Matthew,22,26,"In the same way, the second also, and the third, to the seventh."
Matthew,22,27,"After them all, the woman died."
Matthew,22,28,"In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.”"
Matthew,22,29,"But Jesus answered them, “You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God."
Matthew,22,30,"For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like God’s angels in heaven."
Matthew,22,31,"But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven’t you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,"
Matthew,22,32,"‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?’ God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”"
Matthew,22,33,"When the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching."
Matthew,22,34,"But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together."
Matthew,22,35,"One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him."
Matthew,22,36,"“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?”"
Matthew,22,37,"Jesus said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’"
Matthew,22,38,This is the first and great commandment.
Matthew,22,39,"A second likewise is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’"
Matthew,22,40,The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.”
Matthew,22,41,"Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,"
Matthew,22,42,"saying, “What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him, “Of David.”"
Matthew,22,43,"He said to them, “How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,"
Matthew,22,44,"‘The Lord said to my Lord, sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?’"
Matthew,22,45,"“If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?”"
Matthew,22,46,"No one was able to answer him a word, neither did any man dare ask him any more questions from that day forward."
Matthew,23,1,"Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,"
Matthew,23,2,"saying, “The scribes and the Pharisees sat on Moses’ seat."
Matthew,23,3,"All things therefore whatever they tell you to observe, observe and do, but don’t do their works; for they say, and don’t do."
Matthew,23,4,"For they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them."
Matthew,23,5,"But all their works they do to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad, enlarge the fringes of their garments,"
Matthew,23,6,"and love the place of honor at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues,"
Matthew,23,7,"the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called ‘Rabbi, Rabbi’ by men."
Matthew,23,8,"But don’t you be called ‘Rabbi,’ for one is your teacher, the Christ, and all of you are brothers."
Matthew,23,9,"Call no man on the earth your father, for one is your Father, he who is in heaven."

Matthew,23,11,But he who is greatest among you will be your servant.
Matthew,23,12,"Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."

Matthew,23,14,"“But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men; for you don’t enter in yourselves, neither do you allow those who are entering in to enter."
Matthew,23,15,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel around by sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as yourselves."
Matthew,23,16,"“Woe to you, you blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated.’"
Matthew,23,17,"You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?"
Matthew,23,18,"‘Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is obligated?’"
Matthew,23,19,"You blind fools! For which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?"
Matthew,23,20,"He therefore who swears by the altar, swears by it, and by everything on it."
Matthew,23,21,"He who swears by the temple, swears by it, and by him who has been living in it."
Matthew,23,22,"He who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him who sits on it."
Matthew,23,23,"“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. But you ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone."
Matthew,23,24,"You blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel!"
Matthew,23,25,"“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and unrighteousness."
Matthew,23,26,"You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter, that its outside may become clean also."
Matthew,23,27,"“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitened tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness."
Matthew,23,28,"Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity."
Matthew,23,29,"“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and decorate the tombs of the righteous,"
Matthew,23,30,"and say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we wouldn’t have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.’"
Matthew,23,31,Therefore you testify to yourselves that you are children of those who killed the prophets.
Matthew,23,32,"Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers."
Matthew,23,33,"You serpents, you offspring of vipers, how will you escape the judgment of Gehenna?"
Matthew,23,34,"Therefore behold, I send to you prophets, wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify; and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city;"
Matthew,23,35,"that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar."
Matthew,23,36,"Most certainly I tell you, all these things will come upon this generation."
Matthew,23,37,"“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I would have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you would not!"
Matthew,23,38,"Behold, your house is left to you desolate."
Matthew,23,39,"For I tell you, you will not see me from now on, until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!’”"
Matthew,24,1,"Jesus went out from the temple, and was going on his way. His disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple."
Matthew,24,2,"But he answered them, “You see all of these things, don’t you? Most certainly I tell you, there will not be left here one stone on another, that will not be thrown down.”"
Matthew,24,3,"As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?”"
Matthew,24,4,"Jesus answered them, “Be careful that no one leads you astray."
Matthew,24,5,"For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will lead many astray."
Matthew,24,6,"You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you aren’t troubled, for all this must happen, but the end is not yet."
Matthew,24,7,"For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places."
Matthew,24,8,But all these things are the beginning of birth pains.
Matthew,24,9,"Then they will deliver you up to oppression, and will kill you. You will be hated by all of the nations for my name’s sake."
Matthew,24,10,"Then many will stumble, and will deliver up one another, and will hate one another."
Matthew,24,11,"Many false prophets will arise, and will lead many astray."
Matthew,24,12,"Because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many will grow cold."
Matthew,24,13,"But he who endures to the end, the same will be saved."
Matthew,24,14,"This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come."
Matthew,24,15,"“When, therefore, you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),"
Matthew,24,16,then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
Matthew,24,17,Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out the things that are in his house.
Matthew,24,18,Let him who is in the field not return back to get his clothes.
Matthew,24,19,But woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers in those days!
Matthew,24,20,"Pray that your flight will not be in the winter, nor on a Sabbath,"
Matthew,24,21,"for then there will be great oppression, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be."
Matthew,24,22,"Unless those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved. But for the sake of the chosen ones, those days will be shortened."
Matthew,24,23,"“Then if any man tells you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or, ‘There,’ don’t believe it."
Matthew,24,24,"For there will arise false christs, and false prophets, and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones."
Matthew,24,25,"“Behold, I have told you beforehand."
Matthew,24,26,"If therefore they tell you, ‘Behold, he is in the wilderness,’ don’t go out; ‘Behold, he is in the inner rooms,’ don’t believe it."
Matthew,24,27,"For as the lightning flashes from the east, and is seen even to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man."
Matthew,24,28,"For wherever the carcass is, that is where the vultures gather together."
Matthew,24,29,"But immediately after the oppression of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken;"
Matthew,24,30,"and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory."
Matthew,24,31,"He will send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other."
Matthew,24,32,"“Now from the fig tree learn this parable. When its branch has now become tender, and produces its leaves, you know that the summer is near."
Matthew,24,33,"Even so you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors."
Matthew,24,34,"Most certainly I tell you, this generation will not pass away, until all these things are accomplished."
Matthew,24,35,"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away."
Matthew,24,36,"But no one knows of that day and hour, not even the angels of heaven, but my Father only."
Matthew,24,37,"“As the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man."
Matthew,24,38,"For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship,"
Matthew,24,39,"and they didn’t know until the flood came, and took them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man."
Matthew,24,40,Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and one will be left.
Matthew,24,41,Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and one will be left.
Matthew,24,42,"Watch therefore, for you don’t know in what hour your Lord comes."
Matthew,24,43,"But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into."
Matthew,24,44,"Therefore also be ready, for in an hour that you don’t expect, the Son of Man will come."
Matthew,24,45,"“Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has set over his household, to give them their food in due season?"
Matthew,24,46,Blessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing so when he comes.
Matthew,24,47,Most certainly I tell you that he will set him over all that he has.
Matthew,24,48,"But if that evil servant should say in his heart, ‘My lord is delaying his coming,’"
Matthew,24,49,"and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eat and drink with the drunkards,"
Matthew,24,50,"the lord of that servant will come in a day when he doesn’t expect it, and in an hour when he doesn’t know it,"
Matthew,24,51,"and will cut him in pieces, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. That is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be."
Matthew,25,1,"“Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom."
Matthew,25,2,"Five of them were foolish, and five were wise."
Matthew,25,3,"Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them,"
Matthew,25,4,but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
Matthew,25,5,"Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept."
Matthew,25,6,"But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!’"
Matthew,25,7,"Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps."
Matthew,25,8,"The foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’"
Matthew,25,9,"But the wise answered, saying, ‘What if there isn’t enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.’"
Matthew,25,10,"While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut."
Matthew,25,11,"Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us.’"
Matthew,25,12,"But he answered, ‘Most certainly I tell you, I don’t know you.’"
Matthew,25,13,"Watch therefore, for you don’t know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming."
Matthew,25,14,"“For it is like a man, going into another country, who called his own servants, and entrusted his goods to them."
Matthew,25,15,"To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability. Then he went on his journey."
Matthew,25,16,"Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents."
Matthew,25,17,"In the same way, he also who got the two gained another two."
Matthew,25,18,"But he who received the one talent went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord’s money."
Matthew,25,19,"“Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them."
Matthew,25,20,"He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, ‘Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them.’"
Matthew,25,21,"“His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’"
Matthew,25,22,"“He also who got the two talents came and said, ‘Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents besides them.’"
Matthew,25,23,"“His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’"
Matthew,25,24,"“He also who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter."
Matthew,25,25,"I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.’"
Matthew,25,26,"“But his lord answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn’t sow, and gather where I didn’t scatter."
Matthew,25,27,"You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest."
Matthew,25,28,"Take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents."
Matthew,25,29,"For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away."
Matthew,25,30,"Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’"
Matthew,25,31,"“But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory."
Matthew,25,32,"Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats."
Matthew,25,33,"He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left."
Matthew,25,34,"Then the King will tell those on his right hand, ‘Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;"
Matthew,25,35,"for I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you took me in."
Matthew,25,36,"I was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you visited me. I was in prison, and you came to me.’"
Matthew,25,37,"“Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?"
Matthew,25,38,"When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?"
Matthew,25,39,"When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?’"
Matthew,25,40,"“The King will answer them, ‘Most certainly I tell you, because you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’"
Matthew,25,41,"Then he will say also to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels;"
Matthew,25,42,"for I was hungry, and you didn’t give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;"
Matthew,25,43,"I was a stranger, and you didn’t take me in; naked, and you didn’t clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you didn’t visit me.’"
Matthew,25,44,"“Then they will also answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn’t help you?’"
Matthew,25,45,"“Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Most certainly I tell you, because you didn’t do it to one of the least of these, you didn’t do it to me.’"
Matthew,25,46,"These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”"
Matthew,26,1,"When Jesus had finished all these words, he said to his disciples,"
Matthew,26,2,"“You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.”"
Matthew,26,3,"Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas."
Matthew,26,4,"They took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit, and kill him."
Matthew,26,5,"But they said, “Not during the feast, lest a riot occur among the people.”"
Matthew,26,6,"Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,"
Matthew,26,7,"a woman came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table."
Matthew,26,8,"But when his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, “Why this waste?"
Matthew,26,9,"For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.”"
Matthew,26,10,"However, knowing this, Jesus said to them, “Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good work for me."
Matthew,26,11,For you always have the poor with you; but you don’t always have me.
Matthew,26,12,"For in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial."
Matthew,26,13,"Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her.”"
Matthew,26,14,"Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,"
Matthew,26,15,"and said, “What are you willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you?” They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver."
Matthew,26,16,From that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
Matthew,26,17,"Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”"
Matthew,26,18,"He said, “Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.”’”"
Matthew,26,19,"The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover."
Matthew,26,20,"Now when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples."
Matthew,26,21,"As they were eating, he said, “Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.”"
Matthew,26,22,"They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, “It isn’t me, is it, Lord?”"
Matthew,26,23,"He answered, “He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me."
Matthew,26,24,"The Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born.”"
Matthew,26,25,"Judas, who betrayed him, answered, “It isn’t me, is it, Rabbi?” He said to him, “You said it.”"
Matthew,26,26,"As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.”"
Matthew,26,27,"He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, “All of you drink it,"
Matthew,26,28,"for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins."
Matthew,26,29,"But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s Kingdom.”"
Matthew,26,30,"When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives."
Matthew,26,31,"Then Jesus said to them, “All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’"
Matthew,26,32,"But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.”"
Matthew,26,33,"But Peter answered him, “Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble.”"
Matthew,26,34,"Jesus said to him, “Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”"
Matthew,26,35,"Peter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” All of the disciples also said likewise."
Matthew,26,36,"Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, “Sit here, while I go there and pray.”"
Matthew,26,37,"He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled."
Matthew,26,38,"Then he said to them, “My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me.”"
Matthew,26,39,"He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire.”"
Matthew,26,40,"He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, “What, couldn’t you watch with me for one hour?"
Matthew,26,41,"Watch and pray, that you don’t enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”"
Matthew,26,42,"Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, “My Father, if this cup can’t pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done.”"
Matthew,26,43,"He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy."
Matthew,26,44,"He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words."
Matthew,26,45,"Then he came to his disciples, and said to them, “Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Matthew,26,46,"Arise, let’s be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.”"
Matthew,26,47,"While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people."
Matthew,26,48,"Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him.”"
Matthew,26,49,"Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, “Hail, Rabbi!” and kissed him."
Matthew,26,50,"Jesus said to him, “Friend, why are you here?” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him."
Matthew,26,51,"Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear."
Matthew,26,52,"Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword."
Matthew,26,53,"Or do you think that I couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?"
Matthew,26,54,How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?”
Matthew,26,55,"In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, “Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me."
Matthew,26,56,"But all this has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples left him, and fled."
Matthew,26,57,"Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together."
Matthew,26,58,"But Peter followed him from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end."
Matthew,26,59,"Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death;"
Matthew,26,60,"and they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward,"
Matthew,26,61,"and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.’”"
Matthew,26,62,"The high priest stood up, and said to him, “Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?”"
Matthew,26,63,"But Jesus held his peace. The high priest answered him, “I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.”"
Matthew,26,64,"Jesus said to him, “You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky.”"
Matthew,26,65,"Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy."
Matthew,26,66,"What do you think?” They answered, “He is worthy of death!”"
Matthew,26,67,"Then they spat in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him,"
Matthew,26,68,"saying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you?”"
Matthew,26,69,"Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, “You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!”"
Matthew,26,70,"But he denied it before them all, saying, “I don’t know what you are talking about.”"
Matthew,26,71,"When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there, “This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.”"
Matthew,26,72,"Again he denied it with an oath, “I don’t know the man.”"
Matthew,26,73,"After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, “Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known.”"
Matthew,26,74,"Then he began to curse and to swear, “I don’t know the man!” Immediately the rooster crowed."
Matthew,26,75,"Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” He went out and wept bitterly."
Matthew,27,1,"Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:"
Matthew,27,2,"and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor."
Matthew,27,3,"Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,"
Matthew,27,4,"saying, “I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.” But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it.”"
Matthew,27,5,"He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged himself."
Matthew,27,6,"The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, “It’s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.”"
Matthew,27,7,"They took counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them, to bury strangers in."
Matthew,27,8,Therefore that field was called “The Field of Blood” to this day.
Matthew,27,9,"Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him upon whom a price had been set, whom some of the children of Israel priced,"
Matthew,27,10,"and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”"
Matthew,27,11,"Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus said to him, “So you say.”"
Matthew,27,12,"When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing."
Matthew,27,13,"Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many things they testify against you?”"
Matthew,27,14,"He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly."
Matthew,27,15,"Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired."
Matthew,27,16,"They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas."
Matthew,27,17,"When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?”"
Matthew,27,18,For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.
Matthew,27,19,"While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of him.”"
Matthew,27,20,"Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus."
Matthew,27,21,"But the governor answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” They said, “Barabbas!”"
Matthew,27,22,"Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?” They all said to him, “Let him be crucified!”"
Matthew,27,23,"But the governor said, “Why? What evil has he done?” But they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!”"
Matthew,27,24,"So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.”"
Matthew,27,25,"All the people answered, “May his blood be on us, and on our children!”"
Matthew,27,26,"Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified."
Matthew,27,27,"Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him."
Matthew,27,28,"They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him."
Matthew,27,29,"They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”"
Matthew,27,30,"They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head."
Matthew,27,31,"When they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him."
Matthew,27,32,"As they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross."
Matthew,27,33,"When they came to a place called “Golgotha”, that is to say, “The place of a skull,”"
Matthew,27,34,"they gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink."
Matthew,27,35,"When they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,"
Matthew,27,36,and they sat and watched him there.
Matthew,27,37,"They set up over his head the accusation against him written, “THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”"
Matthew,27,38,"Then there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left."
Matthew,27,39,"Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,"
Matthew,27,40,"and saying, “You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”"
Matthew,27,41,"Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, the Pharisees, and the elders, said,"
Matthew,27,42,"“He saved others, but he can’t save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
Matthew,27,43,"He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”"
Matthew,27,44,The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.
Matthew,27,45,Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
Matthew,27,46,"About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani?” That is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”"
Matthew,27,47,"Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.”"
Matthew,27,48,"Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink."
Matthew,27,49,"The rest said, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.”"
Matthew,27,50,"Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit."
Matthew,27,51,"Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split."
Matthew,27,52,"The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;"
Matthew,27,53,"and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many."
Matthew,27,54,"Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, “Truly this was the Son of God.”"
Matthew,27,55,"Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him."
Matthew,27,56,"Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee."
Matthew,27,57,"When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus’ disciple came."
Matthew,27,58,"This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up."
Matthew,27,59,"Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,"
Matthew,27,60,"and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone against the door of the tomb, and departed."
Matthew,27,61,"Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb."
Matthew,27,62,"Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,"
Matthew,27,63,"saying, “Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise again.’"
Matthew,27,64,"Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He is risen from the dead;’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”"
Matthew,27,65,"Pilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can.”"
Matthew,27,66,"So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone."
Matthew,28,1,"Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb."
Matthew,28,2,"Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it."
Matthew,28,3,"His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow."
Matthew,28,4,"For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men."
Matthew,28,5,"The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified."
Matthew,28,6,"He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying."
Matthew,28,7,"Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.”"
Matthew,28,8,"They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word."
Matthew,28,9,"As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, “Rejoice!” They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him."
Matthew,28,10,"Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me.”"
Matthew,28,11,"Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened."
Matthew,28,12,"When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,"
Matthew,28,13,"saying, “Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept."
Matthew,28,14,"If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.”"
Matthew,28,15,"So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until today."
Matthew,28,16,"But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them."
Matthew,28,17,"When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted."
Matthew,28,18,"Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth."
Matthew,28,19,"Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,"
Matthew,28,20,"teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen."
Mark,1,1,"The beginning of the Good News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God."
Mark,1,2,"As it is written in the prophets, “Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you:"
Mark,1,3,"the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord! Make his paths straight!’”"
Mark,1,4,John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.
Mark,1,5,"All the country of Judea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins."
Mark,1,6,John was clothed with camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
Mark,1,7,"He preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen."
Mark,1,8,"I baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.”"
Mark,1,9,"In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan."
Mark,1,10,"Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove."
Mark,1,11,"A voice came out of the sky, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”"
Mark,1,12,Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
Mark,1,13,He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him.
Mark,1,14,"Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of God’s Kingdom,"
Mark,1,15,"and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and God’s Kingdom is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News.”"
Mark,1,16,"Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen."
Mark,1,17,"Jesus said to them, “Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men.”"
Mark,1,18,"Immediately they left their nets, and followed him."
Mark,1,19,"Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets."
Mark,1,20,"Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him."
Mark,1,21,"They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught."
Mark,1,22,"They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes."
Mark,1,23,"Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,"
Mark,1,24,"saying, “Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!”"
Mark,1,25,"Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet, and come out of him!”"
Mark,1,26,"The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him."
Mark,1,27,"They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!”"
Mark,1,28,The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.
Mark,1,29,"Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John."
Mark,1,30,"Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her."
Mark,1,31,"He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them."
Mark,1,32,"At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed by demons."
Mark,1,33,All the city was gathered together at the door.
Mark,1,34,"He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn’t allow the demons to speak, because they knew him."
Mark,1,35,"Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there."
Mark,1,36,Simon and those who were with him followed after him;
Mark,1,37,"and they found him, and told him, “Everyone is looking for you.”"
Mark,1,38,"He said to them, “Let’s go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason.”"
Mark,1,39,"He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons."
Mark,1,40,"A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, “If you want to, you can make me clean.”"
Mark,1,41,"Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, “I want to. Be made clean.”"
Mark,1,42,"When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean."
Mark,1,43,"He strictly warned him, and immediately sent him out,"
Mark,1,44,"and said to him, “See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”"
Mark,1,45,"But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere."
Mark,2,1,"When he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was in the house."
Mark,2,2,"Immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them."
Mark,2,3,"Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him."
Mark,2,4,"When they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on."
Mark,2,5,"Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven you.”"
Mark,2,6,"But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,"
Mark,2,7,“Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
Mark,2,8,"Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, “Why do you reason these things in your hearts?"
Mark,2,9,"Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?’"
Mark,2,10,But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the paralytic—
Mark,2,11,"“I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house.”"
Mark,2,12,"He arose, and immediately took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”"
Mark,2,13,"He went out again by the seaside. All the multitude came to him, and he taught them."
Mark,2,14,"As he passed by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he arose and followed him."
Mark,2,15,"He was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him."
Mark,2,16,"The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, “Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?”"
Mark,2,17,"When Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”"
Mark,2,18,"John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don’t fast?”"
Mark,2,19,"Jesus said to them, “Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can’t fast."
Mark,2,20,"But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day."
Mark,2,21,"No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made."
Mark,2,22,"No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins.”"
Mark,2,23,"He was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain."
Mark,2,24,"The Pharisees said to him, “Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?”"
Mark,2,25,"He said to them, “Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry—he, and those who were with him?"
Mark,2,26,"How he entered into God’s house at the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?”"
Mark,2,27,"He said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
Mark,2,28,Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”
Mark,3,1,"He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered."
Mark,3,2,"They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him."
Mark,3,3,"He said to the man who had his hand withered, “Stand up.”"
Mark,3,4,"He said to them, “Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?” But they were silent."
Mark,3,5,"When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other."
Mark,3,6,"The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him."
Mark,3,7,"Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,"
Mark,3,8,"from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him."
Mark,3,9,"He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn’t press on him."
Mark,3,10,"For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him."
Mark,3,11,"The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, “You are the Son of God!”"
Mark,3,12,He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.
Mark,3,13,"He went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him."
Mark,3,14,"He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,"
Mark,3,15,and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:
Mark,3,16,Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);
Mark,3,17,"James the son of Zebedee; and John, the brother of James, (whom he called Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder);"
Mark,3,18,"Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;"
Mark,3,19,"and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. Then he came into a house."
Mark,3,20,"The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread."
Mark,3,21,"When his friends heard it, they went out to seize him: for they said, “He is insane.”"
Mark,3,22,"The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.”"
Mark,3,23,"He summoned them, and said to them in parables, “How can Satan cast out Satan?"
Mark,3,24,"If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand."
Mark,3,25,"If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand."
Mark,3,26,"If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can’t stand, but has an end."
Mark,3,27,"But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house."
Mark,3,28,"Most certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;"
Mark,3,29,"but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation.”"
Mark,3,30,"—because they said, “He has an unclean spirit.”"
Mark,3,31,"His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him."
Mark,3,32,"A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, “Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters are outside looking for you.”"
Mark,3,33,"He answered them, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”"
Mark,3,34,"Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, “Behold, my mother and my brothers!"
Mark,3,35,"For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.”"
Mark,4,1,"Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea."
Mark,4,2,"He taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,"
Mark,4,3,"“Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow,"
Mark,4,4,"and as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it."
Mark,4,5,"Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil."
Mark,4,6,"When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away."
Mark,4,7,"Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit."
Mark,4,8,"Others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some produced thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much.”"
Mark,4,9,"He said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.”"
Mark,4,10,"When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables."
Mark,4,11,"He said to them, “To you is given the mystery of God’s Kingdom, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,"
Mark,4,12,"that ‘seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them.’”"
Mark,4,13,"He said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?"
Mark,4,14,The farmer sows the word.
Mark,4,15,"The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them."
Mark,4,16,"These in the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy."
Mark,4,17,"They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble."
Mark,4,18,"Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word,"
Mark,4,19,"and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful."
Mark,4,20,"Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.”"
Mark,4,21,"He said to them, “Is the lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Isn’t it put on a stand?"
Mark,4,22,"For there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light."
Mark,4,23,"If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.”"
Mark,4,24,"He said to them, “Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear."
Mark,4,25,"For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.”"
Mark,4,26,"He said, “God’s Kingdom is as if a man should cast seed on the earth,"
Mark,4,27,"and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, though he doesn’t know how."
Mark,4,28,"For the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear."
Mark,4,29,"But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”"
Mark,4,30,"He said, “How will we liken God’s Kingdom? Or with what parable will we illustrate it?"
Mark,4,31,"It’s like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,"
Mark,4,32,"yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.”"
Mark,4,33,"With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it."
Mark,4,34,Without a parable he didn’t speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.
Mark,4,35,"On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, “Let’s go over to the other side.”"
Mark,4,36,"Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him."
Mark,4,37,"A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled."
Mark,4,38,"He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are dying?”"
Mark,4,39,"He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” The wind ceased, and there was a great calm."
Mark,4,40,"He said to them, “Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?”"
Mark,4,41,"They were greatly afraid, and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”"
Mark,5,1,"They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes."
Mark,5,2,"When he had come out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs."
Mark,5,3,"He lived in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains,"
Mark,5,4,"because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him."
Mark,5,5,"Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones."
Mark,5,6,"When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,"
Mark,5,7,"and crying out with a loud voice, he said, “What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don’t torment me.”"
Mark,5,8,"For he said to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”"
Mark,5,9,"He asked him, “What is your name?” He said to him, “My name is Legion, for we are many.”"
Mark,5,10,He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
Mark,5,11,Now on the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding.
Mark,5,12,"All the demons begged him, saying, “Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.”"
Mark,5,13,"At once Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea."
Mark,5,14,"Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the country. The people came to see what it was that had happened."
Mark,5,15,"They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid."
Mark,5,16,"Those who saw it declared to them what happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs."
Mark,5,17,They began to beg him to depart from their region.
Mark,5,18,"As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him."
Mark,5,19,"He didn’t allow him, but said to him, “Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you.”"
Mark,5,20,"He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled."
Mark,5,21,"When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea."
Mark,5,22,"Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,"
Mark,5,23,"and begged him much, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.”"
Mark,5,24,"He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides."
Mark,5,25,"A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years,"
Mark,5,26,"and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,"
Mark,5,27,"having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes."
Mark,5,28,"For she said, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.”"
Mark,5,29,"Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction."
Mark,5,30,"Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked, “Who touched my clothes?”"
Mark,5,31,"His disciples said to him, “You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’”"
Mark,5,32,He looked around to see her who had done this thing.
Mark,5,33,"But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth."
Mark,5,34,"He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.”"
Mark,5,35,"While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?”"
Mark,5,36,"But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, “Don’t be afraid, only believe.”"
Mark,5,37,"He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the brother of James."
Mark,5,38,"He came to the synagogue ruler’s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing."
Mark,5,39,"When he had entered in, he said to them, “Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep.”"
Mark,5,40,"They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying."
Mark,5,41,"Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, “Talitha cumi!” which means, being interpreted, “Girl, I tell you, get up!”"
Mark,5,42,"Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement."
Mark,5,43,"He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat."
Mark,6,1,"He went out from there. He came into his own country, and his disciples followed him."
Mark,6,2,"When the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things?” and, “What is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands?"
Mark,6,3,"Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon? Aren’t his sisters here with us?” They were offended at him."
Mark,6,4,"Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house.”"
Mark,6,5,"He could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people, and healed them."
Mark,6,6,He marveled because of their unbelief. He went around the villages teaching.
Mark,6,7,"He called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits."
Mark,6,8,"He commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse,"
Mark,6,9,"but to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics."
Mark,6,10,"He said to them, “Wherever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there."
Mark,6,11,"Whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!”"
Mark,6,12,They went out and preached that people should repent.
Mark,6,13,"They cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick, and healed them."
Mark,6,14,"King Herod heard this, for his name had become known, and he said, “John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.”"
Mark,6,15,"But others said, “He is Elijah.” Others said, “He is a prophet, or like one of the prophets.”"
Mark,6,16,"But Herod, when he heard this, said, “This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead.”"
Mark,6,17,"For Herod himself had sent out and arrested John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, for he had married her."
Mark,6,18,"For John said to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”"
Mark,6,19,"Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him, but she couldn’t,"
Mark,6,20,"for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly."
Mark,6,21,"Then a convenient day came, that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee."
Mark,6,22,"When the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him. The king said to the young lady, “Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you.”"
Mark,6,23,"He swore to her, “Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.”"
Mark,6,24,"She went out, and said to her mother, “What shall I ask?” She said, “The head of John the Baptizer.”"
Mark,6,25,"She came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter.”"
Mark,6,26,"The king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner guests, he didn’t wish to refuse her."
Mark,6,27,"Immediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring John’s head, and he went and beheaded him in the prison,"
Mark,6,28,"and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother."
Mark,6,29,"When his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb."
Mark,6,30,"The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught."
Mark,6,31,"He said to them, “You come apart into a deserted place, and rest awhile.” For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat."
Mark,6,32,They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.
Mark,6,33,"They saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to him."
Mark,6,34,"Jesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things."
Mark,6,35,"When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and said, “This place is deserted, and it is late in the day."
Mark,6,36,"Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.”"
Mark,6,37,"But he answered them, “You give them something to eat.” They asked him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give them something to eat?”"
Mark,6,38,"He said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go see.” When they knew, they said, “Five, and two fish.”"
Mark,6,39,He commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass.
Mark,6,40,"They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties."
Mark,6,41,"He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all."
Mark,6,42,"They all ate, and were filled."
Mark,6,43,They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish.
Mark,6,44,Those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.
Mark,6,45,"Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away."
Mark,6,46,"After he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray."
Mark,6,47,"When evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on the land."
Mark,6,48,"Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea, and he would have passed by them,"
Mark,6,49,"but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;"
Mark,6,50,"for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, “Cheer up! It is I! Don’t be afraid.”"
Mark,6,51,"He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled;"
Mark,6,52,"for they hadn’t understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened."
Mark,6,53,"When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore."
Mark,6,54,"When they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,"
Mark,6,55,"and ran around that whole region, and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard he was."
Mark,6,56,"Wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well."
Mark,7,1,"Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem."
Mark,7,2,"Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is unwashed, hands, they found fault."
Mark,7,3,"(For the Pharisees and all the Jews, don’t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders."
Mark,7,4,"They don’t eat when they come from the marketplace unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)"
Mark,7,5,"The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?”"
Mark,7,6,"He answered them, “Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me."
Mark,7,7,"But they worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’"
Mark,7,8,"“For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.”"
Mark,7,9,"He said to them, “Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition."
Mark,7,10,"For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’ and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’"
Mark,7,11,"But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban, that is to say, given to God”;’"
Mark,7,12,"then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,"
Mark,7,13,"making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this.”"
Mark,7,14,"He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand."
Mark,7,15,"There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man."
Mark,7,16,"If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”"
Mark,7,17,"When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable."
Mark,7,18,"He said to them, “Are you also without understanding? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him,"
Mark,7,19,"because it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all foods?”"
Mark,7,20,"He said, “That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man."
Mark,7,21,"For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,"
Mark,7,22,"covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness."
Mark,7,23,"All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.”"
Mark,7,24,"From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice."
Mark,7,25,"For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet."
Mark,7,26,"Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter."
Mark,7,27,"But Jesus said to her, “Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”"
Mark,7,28,"But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”"
Mark,7,29,"He said to her, “For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”"
Mark,7,30,"She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out."
Mark,7,31,"Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the middle of the region of Decapolis."
Mark,7,32,They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.
Mark,7,33,"He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue."
Mark,7,34,"Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, “Ephphatha!” that is, “Be opened!”"
Mark,7,35,"Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly."
Mark,7,36,"He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it."
Mark,7,37,"They were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!”"
2 Thessalonians,2,1,"Now, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together to him, we ask you"
2 Thessalonians,2,2,"not to be quickly shaken in your mind, and not be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by letter as if from us, saying that the day of Christ has already come."
2 Thessalonians,2,3,"Let no one deceive you in any way. For it will not be, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of destruction,"
2 Thessalonians,2,4,"he who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or that is worshiped; so that he sits as God in the temple of God, setting himself up as God."
2 Thessalonians,2,5,"Don’t you remember that, when I was still with you, I told you these things?"
2 Thessalonians,2,6,"Now you know what is restraining him, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season."
2 Thessalonians,2,7,"For the mystery of lawlessness already works. Only there is one who restrains now, until he is taken out of the way."
2 Thessalonians,2,8,"Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth, and destroy by the manifestation of his coming;"
2 Thessalonians,2,9,"even he whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,"
2 Thessalonians,2,10,"and with all deception of wickedness for those who are being lost, because they didn’t receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved."
2 Thessalonians,2,11,"Because of this, God sends them a working of error, that they should believe a lie;"
2 Thessalonians,2,12,"that they all might be judged who didn’t believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
2 Thessalonians,2,13,"But we are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the truth;"
2 Thessalonians,2,14,"to which he called you through our Good News, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
2 Thessalonians,2,15,"So then, brothers, stand firm, and hold the traditions which you were taught by us, whether by word, or by letter."
2 Thessalonians,2,16,"Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,"
2 Thessalonians,2,17,comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word.
2 Thessalonians,3,1,"Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, even as also with you;"
2 Thessalonians,3,2,and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for not all have faith.
2 Thessalonians,3,3,"But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you, and guard you from the evil one."
2 Thessalonians,3,4,"We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both do and will do the things we command."
2 Thessalonians,3,5,"May the Lord direct your hearts into God’s love, and into the perseverance of Christ."
2 Thessalonians,3,6,"Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks in rebellion, and not after the tradition which they received from us."
2 Thessalonians,3,7,"For you know how you ought to imitate us. For we didn’t behave ourselves rebelliously among you,"
2 Thessalonians,3,8,"neither did we eat bread from anyone’s hand without paying for it, but in labor and travail worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you;"
2 Thessalonians,3,9,"not because we don’t have the right, but to make ourselves an example to you, that you should imitate us."
2 Thessalonians,3,10,"For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: “If anyone will not work, don’t let him eat.”"
2 Thessalonians,3,11,"For we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion, who don’t work at all, but are busybodies."
2 Thessalonians,3,12,"Now those who are that way, we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread."
2 Thessalonians,3,13,"But you, brothers, don’t be weary in doing what is right."
2 Thessalonians,3,14,"If any man doesn’t obey our word in this letter, note that man, that you have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed."
2 Thessalonians,3,15,"Don’t count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother."
2 Thessalonians,3,16,Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all.
2 Thessalonians,3,17,"The greeting of me, Paul, with my own hand, which is the sign in every letter: this is how I write."
2 Thessalonians,3,18,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
1 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ our hope;"
1 Timothy,1,2,"to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
1 Timothy,1,3,"As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine,"
1 Timothy,1,4,"and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than God’s stewardship, which is in faith—"
1 Timothy,1,5,"but the goal of this command is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith;"
1 Timothy,1,6,"from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned away to vain talking;"
1 Timothy,1,7,"desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm."
1 Timothy,1,8,"But we know that the law is good, if a person uses it lawfully,"
1 Timothy,1,9,"as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,"
1 Timothy,1,10,"for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;"
1 Timothy,1,11,"according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust."
1 Timothy,1,12,"And I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to service;"
1 Timothy,1,13,"although I was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief."
1 Timothy,1,14,The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy,1,15,"The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief."
1 Timothy,1,16,"However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience, for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life."
1 Timothy,1,17,"Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen."
1 Timothy,1,18,"This instruction I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which were given to you before, that by them you may wage the good warfare;"
1 Timothy,1,19,holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith;
1 Timothy,1,20,"of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme."
1 Timothy,2,1,"I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks, be made for all men:"
1 Timothy,2,2,for kings and all who are in high places; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence.
1 Timothy,2,3,For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;
1 Timothy,2,4,who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth.
1 Timothy,2,5,"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,"
1 Timothy,2,6,who gave himself as a ransom for all; the testimony in its own times;
1 Timothy,2,7,"to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth."
1 Timothy,2,8,"I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting."
1 Timothy,2,9,"In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety; not just with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing;"
1 Timothy,2,10,but (which becomes women professing godliness) with good works.
1 Timothy,2,11,Let a woman learn in quietness with full submission.
1 Timothy,2,12,"But I don’t permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness."
1 Timothy,2,13,"For Adam was first formed, then Eve."
1 Timothy,2,14,"Adam wasn’t deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience;"
1 Timothy,2,15,"but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and sanctification with sobriety."
1 Timothy,3,1,"This is a faithful saying: if a man seeks the office of an overseer, he desires a good work."
1 Timothy,3,2,"The overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest, hospitable, good at teaching;"
1 Timothy,3,3,"not a drinker, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous;"
1 Timothy,3,4,"one who rules his own house well, having children in subjection with all reverence;"
1 Timothy,3,5,"(but if a man doesn’t know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the assembly of God?)"
1 Timothy,3,6,"not a new convert, lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil."
1 Timothy,3,7,"Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside, to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil."
1 Timothy,3,8,"Servants, in the same way, must be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money;"
1 Timothy,3,9,holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
1 Timothy,3,10,Let them also first be tested; then let them serve if they are blameless.
1 Timothy,3,11,"Their wives in the same way must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things."
1 Timothy,3,12,"Let servants be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well."
1 Timothy,3,13,"For those who have served well gain for themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus."
1 Timothy,3,14,"These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly;"
1 Timothy,3,15,"but if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in God’s house, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."
1 Timothy,3,16,"Without controversy, the mystery of godliness is great: God was revealed in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, and received up in glory."
1 Timothy,4,1,"But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,"
1 Timothy,4,2,"through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;"
1 Timothy,4,3,forbidding marriage and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
1 Timothy,4,4,"For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it is received with thanksgiving."
1 Timothy,4,5,For it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.
1 Timothy,4,6,"If you instruct the brothers of these things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which you have followed."
1 Timothy,4,7,But refuse profane and old wives’ fables. Exercise yourself toward godliness.
1 Timothy,4,8,"For bodily exercise has some value, but godliness has value in all things, having the promise of the life which is now, and of that which is to come."
1 Timothy,4,9,This saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance.
1 Timothy,4,10,"For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we have set our trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe."
1 Timothy,4,11,Command and teach these things.
1 Timothy,4,12,"Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those who believe, in word, in your way of life, in love, in spirit, in faith, and in purity."
1 Timothy,4,13,"Until I come, pay attention to reading, to exhortation, and to teaching."
1 Timothy,4,14,"Don’t neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the elders."
1 Timothy,4,15,"Be diligent in these things. Give yourself wholly to them, that your progress may be revealed to all."
1 Timothy,4,16,"Pay attention to yourself, and to your teaching. Continue in these things, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you."
1 Timothy,5,1,"Don’t rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers;"
1 Timothy,5,2,"the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity."
1 Timothy,5,3,Honor widows who are widows indeed.
1 Timothy,5,4,"But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety towards their own family, and to repay their parents, for this is acceptable in the sight of God."
1 Timothy,5,5,"Now she who is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope set on God, and continues in petitions and prayers night and day."
1 Timothy,5,6,But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives.
1 Timothy,5,7,"Also command these things, that they may be without reproach."
1 Timothy,5,8,"But if anyone doesn’t provide for his own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever."
1 Timothy,5,9,"Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,"
1 Timothy,5,10,"being approved by good works, if she has brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the saints’ feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she has diligently followed every good work."
1 Timothy,5,11,"But refuse younger widows, for when they have grown wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;"
1 Timothy,5,12,"having condemnation, because they have rejected their first pledge."
1 Timothy,5,13,"Besides, they also learn to be idle, going about from house to house. Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not."
1 Timothy,5,14,"I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no occasion to the adversary for insulting."
1 Timothy,5,15,For already some have turned away after Satan.
1 Timothy,5,16,"If any man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and don’t let the assembly be burdened; that it might relieve those who are widows indeed."
1 Timothy,5,17,"Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching."
1 Timothy,5,18,"For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain.” And, “The laborer is worthy of his wages.”"
1 Timothy,5,19,"Don’t receive an accusation against an elder, except at the word of two or three witnesses."
1 Timothy,5,20,"Those who sin, reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear."
1 Timothy,5,21,"I command you in the sight of God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the chosen angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality."
1 Timothy,5,22,"Lay hands hastily on no one, neither be a participant in other men’s sins. Keep yourself pure."
1 Timothy,5,23,"Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your stomach’s sake and your frequent infirmities."
1 Timothy,5,24,"Some men’s sins are evident, preceding them to judgment, and some also follow later."
1 Timothy,5,25,"In the same way also there are good works that are obvious, and those that are otherwise can’t be hidden."
1 Timothy,6,1,"Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed."
1 Timothy,6,2,"Those who have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brothers, but rather let them serve them, because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. Teach and exhort these things."
1 Timothy,6,3,"If anyone teaches a different doctrine, and doesn’t consent to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,"
1 Timothy,6,4,"he is conceited, knowing nothing, but obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come envy, strife, insulting, evil suspicions,"
1 Timothy,6,5,"constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. Withdraw yourself from such."
1 Timothy,6,6,But godliness with contentment is great gain.
1 Timothy,6,7,"For we brought nothing into the world, and we certainly can’t carry anything out."
1 Timothy,6,8,"But having food and clothing, we will be content with that."
1 Timothy,6,9,"But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men in ruin and destruction."
1 Timothy,6,10,"For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows."
1 Timothy,6,11,"But you, man of God, flee these things, and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness."
1 Timothy,6,12,"Fight the good fight of faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses."
1 Timothy,6,13,"I command you before God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate testified the good confession,"
1 Timothy,6,14,"that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
1 Timothy,6,15,"which in its own times he will show, who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;"
1 Timothy,6,16,"who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and eternal power. Amen."
1 Timothy,6,17,"Charge those who are rich in this present world that they not be haughty, nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on the living God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy;"
1 Timothy,6,18,"that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to share;"
1 Timothy,6,19,"laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold of eternal life."
1 Timothy,6,20,"Timothy, guard that which is committed to you, turning away from the empty chatter and oppositions of what is falsely called knowledge;"
1 Timothy,6,21,"which some profess, and thus have wandered from the faith. Grace be with you. Amen."
2 Timothy,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,"
2 Timothy,1,2,"to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
2 Timothy,1,3,"I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day"
2 Timothy,1,4,"longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;"
2 Timothy,1,5,"having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also."
2 Timothy,1,6,"For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands."
2 Timothy,1,7,"For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control."
2 Timothy,1,8,"Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God,"
2 Timothy,1,9,"who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,"
2 Timothy,1,10,"but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News."
2 Timothy,1,11,"For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles."
2 Timothy,1,12,"For this cause I also suffer these things. Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day."
2 Timothy,1,13,"Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,1,14,"That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us."
2 Timothy,1,15,"This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes."
2 Timothy,1,16,"May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,"
2 Timothy,1,17,"but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me"
2 Timothy,1,18,"(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well."
2 Timothy,2,1,"You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,2,2,"The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also."
2 Timothy,2,3,"You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,2,4,"No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier."
2 Timothy,2,5,"Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules."
2 Timothy,2,6,The farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the crops.
2 Timothy,2,7,"Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things."
2 Timothy,2,8,"Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the offspring of David, according to my Good News,"
2 Timothy,2,9,in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained.
2 Timothy,2,10,"Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory."
2 Timothy,2,11,"This saying is trustworthy: “For if we died with him, we will also live with him."
2 Timothy,2,12,"If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he also will deny us."
2 Timothy,2,13,"If we are faithless, he remains faithful. For he can’t deny himself.”"
2 Timothy,2,14,"Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don’t argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear."
2 Timothy,2,15,"Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth."
2 Timothy,2,16,"But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,"
2 Timothy,2,17,"and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;"
2 Timothy,2,18,"men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some."
2 Timothy,2,19,"However God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal, “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.”"
2 Timothy,2,20,"Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor."
2 Timothy,2,21,"If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work."
2 Timothy,2,22,"Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart."
2 Timothy,2,23,"But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife."
2 Timothy,2,24,"The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,"
2 Timothy,2,25,"in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,"
2 Timothy,2,26,"and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to his will."
2 Timothy,3,1,"But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come."
2 Timothy,3,2,"For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,"
2 Timothy,3,3,"without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not lovers of good,"
2 Timothy,3,4,"traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;"
2 Timothy,3,5,"holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also."
2 Timothy,3,6,"For some of these are people who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,"
2 Timothy,3,7,"always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."
2 Timothy,3,8,"Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith are rejected."
2 Timothy,3,9,"But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be."
2 Timothy,3,10,"But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,"
2 Timothy,3,11,"persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all."
2 Timothy,3,12,"Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution."
2 Timothy,3,13,"But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived."
2 Timothy,3,14,"But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them."
2 Timothy,3,15,"From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus."
2 Timothy,3,16,"Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,"
2 Timothy,3,17,"that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work."
2 Timothy,4,1,"I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:"
2 Timothy,4,2,"preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with all patience and teaching."
2 Timothy,4,3,"For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts;"
2 Timothy,4,4,"and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn away to fables."
2 Timothy,4,5,"But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry."
2 Timothy,4,6,"For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come."
2 Timothy,4,7,I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith.
2 Timothy,4,8,"From now on, there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing."
2 Timothy,4,9,"Be diligent to come to me soon,"
2 Timothy,4,10,"for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia."
2 Timothy,4,11,"Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service."
2 Timothy,4,12,But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
2 Timothy,4,13,"Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments."
2 Timothy,4,14,"Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds,"
2 Timothy,4,15,of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words.
2 Timothy,4,16,"At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them."
2 Timothy,4,17,"But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion."
2 Timothy,4,18,"And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom; to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen."
2 Timothy,4,19,"Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus."
2 Timothy,4,20,"Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick."
2 Timothy,4,21,"Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers."
2 Timothy,4,22,The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
Titus,1,1,"Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,"
Titus,1,2,"in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began;"
Titus,1,3,but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;
Titus,1,4,"to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior."
Titus,1,5,"I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you;"
Titus,1,6,"if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior."
Titus,1,7,"For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;"
Titus,1,8,"but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;"
Titus,1,9,"holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him."
Titus,1,10,"For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,"
Titus,1,11,"whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake."
Titus,1,12,"One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.”"
Titus,1,13,"This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,"
Titus,1,14,not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
Titus,1,15,"To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled."
Titus,1,16,"They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work."
Titus,2,1,"But say the things which fit sound doctrine,"
Titus,2,2,"that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance:"
Titus,2,3,"and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;"
Titus,2,4,"that they may train the young wives to love their husbands, to love their children,"
Titus,2,5,"to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed."
Titus,2,6,"Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded;"
Titus,2,7,"in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,"
Titus,2,8,"and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us."
Titus,2,9,"Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;"
Titus,2,10,"not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things."
Titus,2,11,"For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,"
Titus,2,12,"instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age;"
Titus,2,13,"looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;"
Titus,2,14,"who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works."
Titus,2,15,Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.
Titus,3,1,"Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,"
Titus,3,2,"to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men."
Titus,3,3,"For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another."
Titus,3,4,"But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,"
Titus,3,5,"not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,"
Titus,3,6,"whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;"
Titus,3,7,"that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life."
Titus,3,8,"This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;"
Titus,3,9,"but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain."
Titus,3,10,"Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning,"
Titus,3,11,"knowing that such a one is perverted and sins, being self-condemned."
Titus,3,12,"When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there."
Titus,3,13,"Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them."
Titus,3,14,"Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful."
Titus,3,15,All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
